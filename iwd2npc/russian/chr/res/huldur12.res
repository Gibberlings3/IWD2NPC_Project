Hildury, a product of raids, slavery and brutality comes from an Orc tribe of Cutlass, and had once led a life of a typical raider. Her fate had changed when a knight of the Order of the Radiant Heart, Wind Nord, captured her on a battlefield. The Paladin healed the dying orc woman; this action and (what Hildury describes as wise) words made Hildury repent and seek redemption. Nord, a rough but perceptive man, saw her sincerity. His superiors did not, but allowed him to be her liege, and therefore carry responsibility for any trespass commits. Hildury entered this employ with zeal of a neophyte, not out of a fear of being hanged for banditry.  Her loyalty to Sir Nord is absolute and she'd rather kill herself than fail him.
