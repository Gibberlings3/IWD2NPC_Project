At first glance, Wind Nord does not seem to have a past, or at least a past of any interest. By his speech he is a commoner, who compensates for his lack of refinement with a healthy dose of common sense. His enormous strength, perhaps, assured him a position of a squire in the Order of the Radiant Heart, and he must have distinguished himself over the years to become a full-fledged Knight of the Order. From time to time under Nord's gruff exterior one can glean a hint of a more educated man. The paladin credits it to some of the nobles' idiocy rubbing off on him. Wind Nord currently travels with a half-orc squire, Hildury, protecting the weak of the Savage Frontier.
