This haughty elf is surrounded with an aura of mystery, but before long one gets an uncomfortable feeling that the man is connected to two extremist organizations: Eldreth Veluuthra, dedicated to exterminating all humans and reclaiming the elven lands; and the Shadow Druids, who preach even more radical doctrine that calls for eradication of all civilizations. Just how deeply Diriel is engaged with either one, remains unknown, but you suspect that his presence in the North is due to a conflict with the law. He seems to be exceptionally well educated and bred.
