Rizdaer, was an ordinary soldier in one of the minor Houses of Menzoberranzan, but less skilled than most drow in plotting. When one of the surface raids went spectacularly bad - the drow band was chased by Shevarash avatar himself- Rizdaer's contender for a captain's position used the opportunity to stick a blade in his back. Rizdaer was consequently found in precarious position by a group of village children, who thanks to Shevarash's intervention did not face the horror of the drow. So they treated the spectacular black elf as a game, sneaking away food and helping him heal. From them the fighter learnt rudimentary Common. Rizdaer knew quite well that alone he stood no chance of returning even after recovery. He planned to set a camp by the entryway, but a mother of one of the kids discovered the ruse. After initial fright the said rustic lady reckoned that the man who spent two months with the children, never hurting one, was not a threat, and at that he was quite a looker. She persuaded her husband to hire the strong field hand despite his race, and Rizdaer worked through the whole harvest by day, while attending to the lady's needs by night. With the season at an end, and no more work available, Rizdaer set out with a few coppers in his pocket, and a pack stuffed with baked goodies, a spell to bleach his skin (that the lady was routinely purchasing for herself from a local druid) and plenty of red ash bark to change the color of his hair. By that time, he saw no reason to find his way back to the Underdark. While he thought that the Surfacers were little different from drow, if more hypocritical, he liked the notion that a man had a better station. Rizdaer went to Neverwinter, where he passed himself for a half-drow and soldiered for a while. His barrack mates had no liking for having to serve with a drow-spawn, and soon an ugly fight broke out. By the time an officer came by, two of Rizdaer's attackers were slain. Rizdaer was to be hanged, but at the time, the priests of Tyr were collecting the able-bodied criminals to be sent to the besieged Ten Towns to fight their way to redemption or die in lieu of execution. Your mercenary company was entrusted with delivering Rizdaer to Targos and surrendering him to the custody of Lord Ulbrec.
