@0    = ~Why, a token of appreciation from an intriguing man like you is extremely flattering.~
@1    = ~Alas, I'm rather determined to kill you.~
@2    = ~Likewise, but I wanted you to know before you die just how much I enjoyed our little chats. You have the sort of dry wit I particulary admire in men.~
@3    = ~Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake shunning female company but for my sister's. What do you think, Madae, did I err?~
@4    = ~It does be breaking my heart seeing these tears. No man should be suffering! The Order should see to it.~
@5    = ~I am grateful, Jerre.  Farewell.~
@6    = ~The Order can't make every man and woman happy, Hildury. But we will be fixing these men's plight, that's for damn sure!~
@7    = ~So, this is your world. And mine. (He looks around in bewilderment.)~
@8    = ~Well, let's not allow the cambions to take it away from you and I. (He finds your hand and pulls you closer to him. You stand by the drow's side looking over the greens and whites of the North, and the fresh wind prickles your skin.)~
@9    = ~I have a strange feeling just now. As if… as if I am going to live forever. (He leans over and kisses you.) And all gods be damned if you did not teach me just why living is so good.~
@10   = ~Wow, I'm all dizzy. Maybe it's the height; maybe it's this feeling that we're about to finish this adventure!~
@11   = ~At any rate, it's a very good place to for me to kiss you good luck, sweetie!~
@12   = ~(Kiss.)~
@13   = ~And for you to kiss me a good luck….~
@14   = ~And just for kissing….~
@15   = ~(A shower of kisses.)~
@16   = ~Ah, too bad it has to be over so quickly.~
@17   = ~I wish we could refuse just like him. But I have a feeling that we will have to suffer through this... play to please the local Lord. I'll make it up to you, darling, with a performance that will be set up exclusively for you. And, trust me, I am hotter than any Flamewalker.~
@18   = ~Pleasant journeys…. (Salomeya sighs and gives you a sidelong glance.)
(Her whisper touches your ear.) Pleasant journeys… that's what the concubines in Turmish call the pass of a woman's tongue along a man's body. I'll let you guess where and how the journey ends.~
@19   = ~How did you get here?~
@20   = ~Nheero told us that he and his traveling companion, Mandal Graye, entered the base of Dragon's Eye from the Fields of Slaughter.  Once they reached the next level he let himself be captured by a group of yuan-ti abominations while Mandal snuck away to continue his mission.~
@21   = ~How did you get here again?~
@22   = ~What was Mandal's mission again?~
@23   = ~Likewise, Nheero.~
@24   = ~I... I'm sorry. I think I need a moment to myself.~
@25   = ~A very impressive technique, Salomeya. Care to demonstrate?~
@26   = ~I can't imagine. You will have to give me a hint. ~
@27   = ~Not yet, darling, not yet. But one day… who knows.~
@28   = ~(Your answer is melodic laughter and a quizzical smile.)~
@29   = ~A nice view. I suppose we should enjoy it while we can, because my artistic intuition tells me that we are heading into an epic final battle, that shall resolve this contest between a cambion and a <CLASS>.~
@30   = ~I suppose I shall be kind and kiss you before your possible heroic death… or before the grievous wounds Isair may inflict upon you render you too hideous for such pursuits.~
@31   = ~You know what your problem is, woman? You talk too much.~
@32   = ~There is a third possibility. I won't die and will remain ruggedly handsome.~
@33   = ~Hurry up then.~
@34   = ~Then make it a kiss worth dying for, Salomeya!~
@35   = ~Thank you, but I must decline. I do not need your condescending kiss.~
@36   = ~(Salomeya glides over to you, her eyes not leaving your face. She puts one slender finger on your chin and tilts your head towards hers. Slowly, so very slowly she traces her lips with that impossible tongue of hers.)~
@37   = ~(She puts her arms around your neck and draws you into a long and passionate kiss.)~
@38   = ~Oh, my… you do have… potential….  I… I'm starting to look forward to what might happen between you and I if you defeat Isair, my song.~
@39   = ~Suit yourself.~
@40   = ~And, more importantly, sung across the realms.~
@41   = ~So wonderfully impatient you are, my dear! Good things come to those who wait.~
@42   = ~Then I'll open my legs to you.~
@43   = ~Then let the silence reign for a moment…~
@44   = ~Shh. I am savoring the moment. If only I could store it into a magic crystal and relive it again and again.~
@45   = ~Slaying an avatar… why, I think you might have moved me to write something I'd sworn off writing! A love song, and a proper mushy one at that.~
@46   = ~No, Salomeya, anything but a song! Please… if you love me at all.~
@47   = ~I am stunned.~
@48   = ~I'm all ears!~
@49   = ~Please, don't ascribe all the glory to just me. You know that I could not have achieved this victory without my friends.~
@50   = ~And, for the sake of being complete, there were also a few insignificant characters who helped Salomeya and <CHARNAME> defeat the avatar of Xvim.~
@51   = ~Standing over the corpse of a dead god
I cannot take my eyes off your bloodied sword
My heart is beating fast, oh my poor heart….
How can I not fall in love?~
@52   = ~This battle raged like a perfect storm
I sang my songs and you chopped and chopped
We won and it's quieter than in a nest of a dove
How can I not fall in love?~
@53   = ~Oh come to me, let me be the first to sing,
To crown us with the winner's wreath
And to say while being still in awe of
How can I not fall in love?~
@54   = ~With youuuuuu…..~
@55   = ~Worry not, it will be a proper tribute to everyone.~
@56   = ~Tsk, tsk. You should have waited till I sang it. Now you'll have to drop senseless in admiration or become enchanted like the men do for those fish-stinking sirens.~
@57   = ~Pah, remain unsung then, dolt.~
@58   = ~How I love this bustle! All these slaves repairing our future palace, so very inspiring.~
@59   = ~My love, you will make the most beautiful Lady of Severed Hand ever!~
@60   = ~I don't like you being so casual about the slave labor. These people will have to be set free.~
@61   = ~My future palace; yours if I let you to share my bed for a while.~
@62   = ~Salomeya, if you start paying attention you'll also see the guards, half-dragons, chimeras, immortal demons and oh! There are also two cambions lurking somewhere. Those interest me more than the pathetic slaves at the moment.~
@63   = ~As they should. After all I charged you with kicking Madae's enormous backside off of my throne to be.~
@64   = ~Pfft.~
@65   = ~Tsk, tsk. If you think you will be able to attract the workers here out of their own free will afterwards, you are a fool. Or you are going to waste all the gold we won. In either case, you'll end up alone in the empty and majestic halls.~
@66   = ~Then you'll regret not listening to my advice and keeping the slaves. I am sure this demon can be persuaded to work for us....~
@67   = ~Oh, definitely. You just need to kick this ugly cow Madae from my throne to be.~
@68   = ~Oh, this is disgusting!~
@69   = ~Salomeya, we will change back really soon.~
@70   = ~Really? And I think it's an improvement actually where you are concerned.~
@71   = ~I'm sorry that you find my appearance revolting.~
@72   = ~Well, love, it's all about personality now.~
@73   = ~I thought you were a bit of an actress used to the costumes, makeup and masks.~
@74   = ~I only play beautiful women.~
@75   = ~Oh, Beshaba! I won't survive for long in this... body. And I shudder to think that a single mistake in formulation, and that 'disguise' could become permanent!~
@76   = ~Yours? Oh, no. You didn't change all that much.~
@77   = ~But myself! Oh, Beshaba! I won't survive for long in this... body. And I shudder to think that a single mistake in formulation, and that 'disguise' could become permanent!~
@78   = ~Oh, go to the Hells with your rotten japes! I won't survive for long in this... body. And I shudder to think that a single mistake in formulation, and that 'disguise' could become permanent!~
@79   = ~The sooner the better! I won't survive for long in this... body. And I shudder to think that a single mistake in formulation, and that 'disguise' could become permanent!~
@80   = ~Such disgusting creatures…. But what a sway they have over the weaker minds!~
@81   = ~Envious, my love?~
@82   = ~Weaker ones, like yours?~
@83   = ~Yes, and that's what is the *most* disgusting about them. You might want to remember that.~
@84   = ~I wish I had their power. A few well-aimed thoughts - and Salomeya is mine.~
@85   = ~My dear, your ignorance is insufferable. And that's what makes your opinions not worth my paying any mind to.~
@86   = ~Only a complete oaf would!~
@87   = ~(Sigh.) You just can't think big, can you? (But she looks surprisingly pleased.)~
@88   = ~Oh, please….~
@89   = ~Ah, that goes to show just who has the weaker mind.~
@90   = ~A little bit. Life would have been so much easier for a bard if she had psionic powers.~
@91   = ~Not that I can't win the crowds without it, of course.~
@92   = ~I never doubted that!~
@93   = ~Yeah, right.~
@94   = ~Right. I hate to interrupt your litany of self-praise, but we must move.~
@95   = ~Ah, just look at this! A man of grace and power in this wilderness!~
@96   = ~Why, Salomeya, I am flattered! ~
@97   = ~And who would that be? ~
@98   = ~What?! Did you spot Isair?! ~
@99   = ~Please, this mother Eugenia was old when the hills were young. No, I am afraid that my sorry condition is entirely your fault. (She gives you a long seductive look from under her tresses for a smoldering hint.)~
@100  = ~No, I am afraid he is not my type…. (She gives you a long seductive look from under her tresses, which gives you a smoldering hint of just who her fare is.)~
@101  = ~That's not very charitable of you to laugh at my misfortune. A misfortune that you might have caused.~
@102  = ~You wish. (She gives you a long seductive look from under her tresses, which tells you that you didn't miss your guess.)~
@103  = ~I am talking about Iselore, of course.~
@104  = ~(Sigh.) And I am not in the least attracted to him. There must be something wrong with this druid.~
@105  = ~Or there is something 'wrong' with you. For example, you love me too much to care for other men. ~
@106  = ~YES!~
@107  = ~He is a decent man, good at heart. Not the type you fancy at all. ~
@108  = ~Oh, that must be because you don't want him to betray the memory of his dear dead love Mother Egenia on the bed of oak leaves or whatever he has in his tree-house. ~
@109  = ~How is that the drow are so attractive, and the driders are so ugly?~
@110  = ~You find me handsome?~
@111  = ~The driders are not all that ugly once you get used to the eight legs and the rump. ~
@112  = ~Because the drow, twisted as they may be, still have a shred of goodness in them. The driders are bereft of any emotion save for the bloodlust, even when they are compared to drow. ~
@113  = ~I wouldn't call the drow attractive. They like to skulk far too much; they are too dark-skinned to distinguish their features, and they have these shifty eyes… red eyes… Brr. ~
@114  = ~Driders, blah…. Do you find me handsome?~
@115  = ~My dear, I am in love with you. It's to be expected that to me a drider looks like an unearthly beauty. ~
@116  = ~Pfft. I think you've taken a hundred or so blows too many to the head.~
@117  = ~If I were you, I'd be more afraid of boring me than of angering me with an argument.~
@118  = ~A wise attitude, but soooo boring.~
@119  = ~Oh, that you do, famously and unfailingly, darling.~
@120  = ~I think you've taken a blow too many to the head.~
@121  = ~Are you saying… are you saying that you don't think I am beautiful?~
@122  = ~Precisely. I think you are every kind of ugly.~
@123  = ~I was just teasing you. You are beautiful.~
@124  = ~You are not that bad, really. It could have been worse.~
@125  = ~I assure you, that you are better than a hagspawn. Why, I saw one once, in a cage. Brr. Even the memory makes me shiver with disgust.~
@126  = ~Let's be away from here and among Malavon's people… I need to rest my eyes on something pleasant, and there is no proper light for a mirror.~
@127  = ~Why, of course I am.~
@128  = ~Pfft. Let's be away from here and among Malavon's people… I need to rest my eyes on something pleasant, and there is no proper light for a mirror.~
@129  = ~Personality, what personality?~
@130  = ~Pfft. Let's be away from here and among Malavon's people… I need to rest my eyes on something pleasant.~
@131  = ~Yes, but their nimble limbs, their slender bodies, their grace… Ah, they are very pretty.~
@132  = ~And the driders are awful. Let's be away from here and among Malavon's people… I need to rest my eyes on something pleasant.~
@133  = ~Feh. If goodness made people pretty, the priests of Lathander would all have been handsome devils. And I can tell you for a certainty that they are not.~
@134  = ~Goodness contributes to a higher form of beauty than the superficial one that you understand. ~
@135  = ~Well, whatever you say. I don't want to argue about it. ~
@136  = ~Right you are!~
@137  = ~Eww… Are you serious?~
@138  = ~Dead serious. ~
@139  = ~No, just trying to put a smile on your face. ~
@140  = ~Well, yes, your appearance is your strong suit.~
@141  = ~And that's in addition to my winsome personality! ~
@142  = ~I think you are very beautiful, Salomeya. ~
@143  = ~Really? And I thought I was uglier than a hagspawn. ~
@144  = ~Well, I was always of the opinion that at least one out of a couple has to look good. And with you being how you are….~
@145  = ~What has the world come to? Dolon's affair started as a perfectly decent plot, and ended as a… mess.~
@146  = ~I don't care how it ended, as long as it gives us the access to the Underdark passage.~
@147  = ~Love is a mess, Salomeya. It defies reason and overrides machinations.~
@148  = ~I am glad that they found each other. Sometimes I wish that you would stop playing your games, and told me honestly that you loved me, and let me take you away somewhere where *we* could have a fresh start.~
@149  = ~Don't you want to fall in love like that, in spite of everything? ~
@150  = ~Yes, that little stint was ridiculous. Brainless fools. ~
@151  = ~Feh. I'd rather you bequeathed of me your earthly possession than of your earthly body.~
@152  = ~Bone, tissue and blood! I'm very, very romantic, darling. For a right man.~
@153  = ~The sad thing is that they are not necessarily stupid… just in love. A stupid kind of love.~
@154  = ~No. I hate doing things against my will.~
@155  = ~Darling, I have a bad feeling that your idea of a fresh start is being poor and lonely in some flowery and uncivilized place.~
@156  = ~However, if the fresh start involves ruling some flowery place, from a citadel full of riches and servants, I am all yours, body and soul!~
@157  = ~Only if you let it. For example, why did they have to leave, when they were running the place? It would have been much, much more desirable if Dolon could prove his love by sharing his knowledge of Chimeras with us, and helping us to infiltrate the organization. Pfft.~
@158  = ~You don't have a single romantic bone in your body!~
@159  = ~And you do?~
@160  = ~Well, after I die, you can take apart my skeleton and see if you find any. ~
@161  = ~That little stint was ridiculous. Brainless fools. ~
@162  = ~Oh, my goodness, and a woman can come to love this measly creature? If I grew up in a hunting village, I'd have fallen in love with the best hunter.~
@163  = ~I don't doubt this.~
@164  = ~Anja is not like you. She appreciates that Jari loves her, and does not consider her a trophy to be won!~
@165  = ~Indeed, why this Anja is willing to scrape the bottom of the barrel, I have no idea.~
@166  = ~Heh, it just occurred to me that I won that little competition. Should I go look for Anja's father, Salomeya?~
@167  = ~Alas, in a world more complex than a backwater hunting village, it's sometimes difficult to chose the winner among the suitors.~
@168  = ~But at least I am reminded to keep my standards up. I am afraid they have been sinking lately. (Salomeya gives you a cursory look and sighs.)~
@169  = ~Oh, really? That's why he rejected the offer of the wolf's pelt from you. Wait! No, he *took* it to go and buy his Anja. Pfft.~
@170  = ~Neither do I.... And I am afraid that my own standards have been sinking lately. (Salomeya gives you a cursory look and sighs.)~
@171  = ~Only if you are afraid to keep your eyes on a better target, darling.~
@172  = ~Hmph, this girl, she is mooning after you, mark my words.~
@173  = ~I'm sure he has his reasons.  What is this place?~
@174  = ~I'm sure he has his reasons.  What is this place again?~
@175  = ~It's best he's out of harm's way.  In any event, I've come to purchase supplies.~
@176  = ~It's best he's out of harm's way.  In any event, can I see what you have in stock?~
@177  = ~Tell me about it.  I suspect the next mission he sends me on will take me to the Abyss with only a loincloth and a dagger.~
@178  = ~If that's true, I am a happy man. And I have a cause to be more and more opposed to getting killed on one of the Lord Ulbrec's escapades.~
@179  = ~I must take my leave.  Farewell.~
@180  = ~Wee! We're shopping! Can I buy myself a nice spell or two? Something bright and sparkly?~
@181  = ~Of course you can, Peony. You can spend your share of the loot however you want.~
@182  = ~I know it is too much to ask, but can you pick something that is more likely to kill the enemy instead of us?~
@183  = ~Pick whatever you want, and I'll make you a gift of it, sweetheart. ~
@184  = ~My dear lady, if it was up to me you'd be showered with scrolls, you'd have them by the basketful, if that puts a smile on your face!~
@185  = ~No.~
@186  = ~In a loincloth? Then I'll be coming with you to keep you out of troubles with the succubus!~
@187  = ~(She sticks a tongue out at you.) Spoilsport!~
@188  = ~Hey, it's the thought that counts! And it is a very, very nice thought!~
@189  = ~Oh, thank you! You are sooooo sweet!~
@190  = ~And it wasn't me who killed Salomeya! Not that I wasn't tempted - especially after she tried to sink her talons into you - but who was not? ~
@191  = ~If I wasn't so careful with my awesome powers Salomeya would have been dead, that's for sure. Well, at least after she tried to sink her talons into you!~
@192  = ~Oh, pleaaaase! I am taking every precaution when I cast spells. I mean, how is it my fault that everyone keeps running into it? Pfft.~
@193  = ~Oh, well… Thanks for nothing then!~
@194  = ~Your life is worth half a copper. My hero to be, I was almost mad with you but then I heard the clinking of coin in the orcs' pockets. That was a lovely combination of a noble deed and decent pay. I congratulate you.~
@195  = ~Why don't you go search the corpses? I mean, that should be far more fun for you than clinging to his arm like that!~
@196  = ~Oh, this is fun, shorty. Besides, it guarantees that the coins will find their way into my pockets... or down my neckline. A finder's fee is such a finicky thing in an adventuring party!~
@197  = ~That was a smashing battle! And you were so smashingly great, <CHARNAME>, smashing all those goblins to tiny pieces!~
@198  = ~Hmm, did we watch the same man?~
@199  = ~I sure hope NOT!~
@200  = ~We're all looking at the same man, but each of us sees a different one.~
@201  = ~What?! Oh, Prachi, you need to do something about your language. Because that's *not* Common, no Sir!~
@202  = ~Did I see you swoon when the druid was going on about the triplets working in concert? I've known men who'd sell their souls for being subjected to such powers... between the sheets.~
@203  = ~Salomeya, you are the only woman I want. And I wager you alone are worth all three combined in bed.~
@204  = ~Must you debase this perfectly moral bloodshed with your innuendo?~
@205  = ~I have a feeling that the last thing on the girls' minds when they see us would be hopping into bed with me.~
@206  = ~Ooooh....~
@207  = ~The very hint that I could be one of those men deeply offends me, my lady.~
@208  = ~I am a normal man, so I like dangerous women. One at a time.~
@209  = ~That's smart of you. You could well live a long life.~
@210  = ~Ah, but I did not think you were one of those men... simply *a* man.~
@211  = ~You can stop drooling. It's rather unlikely that the staunch Auril priestesses would hop into bed with you.~
@212  = ~I suppose that this ice temple can predispose a person to use cold logic in place of imagination.~
@213  = ~Oh, I see. You've got *standards*. Hacking these poor women to bleeding pieces is righteous, and loving them is immoral. Typical paladin thinking.~
@214  = ~There is something touching about your clumsiness with words.~
@215  = ~Keep this up, darling, and you might just get your wish.~
@216  = ~Of course he does. You make an adorable errand boy, paladin's son. Why, you should really marry a Waterdevian lady. It was just coming into fashion to have an obedient little page for a husband in high society when I left. You'll fit right in. Pfft.~
@217  = ~Yes, here is the message.  And, you'll be pleased to know that Kruntur still lives.~
@218  = ~Uhm, wait a moment. I need to sort things out with the lady here.~
@219  = ~Forget it! I changed my mind!~
@220  = ~Well, maybe I should do just that! Marry a nice girl-~
@221  = ~You have a strong stomach to keep this succubus around, fleshy mortal.~
@222  = ~We returned with Yquog's message.  Unfortunately, we had no way of reading the message from the so-called "masters," since it was written in some sort of Abyssal language.  At least now we know we are dealing with someone, or something, that is familiar with the ways of the Abyss.~
@223  = ~Women make fools of all men. Well, prepare to be consumed... for love.~
@224  = ~...and serve her loyally. Your father would be so very proud and I'll remember to look under her thumbs if I need you for anything twenty years from now. Here is your message, demon.~
@225  = ~You might have plenty of males in your herd, troll, but our leader here is a choice morsel.~
@226  = ~You shall rule nothing, Vrek.  I will slay you and all who serve you.~
@227  = ~Thank you for your vote of confidence, Salomeya, but I must decline the role of a stallion. Instead, I am going to slay the troll and his minions!~
@228  = ~Do you truly find me attractive, Salomeya?~
@229  = ~No, I'm just trying to give your life a higher meaning.~
@230  = ~Vrek tire of you and the female. You don't breed, just talk. Die now!~
@231  = ~We shall see about that!~
@232  = ~Trust me, I'd love nothing more than to breed with this female between silk sheets, but she's all talk. Anyway, I can see that you've lost all interest in our complex relationship, so… Die!~
@233  = ~We are not of your herd, troll, and I will gladly slaughter you for the insulting remarks about my lady Salomeya! ~
@234  = ~So you do think that I am handsome… Oh, Salomeya, I'm so happy to hear that!~
@235  = ~Stop talk! DIE!~
@236  = ~Darling, you'll look even prettier *after* you kill this smelly troll!~
@237  = ~It was my pleasure.  Farewell, Lady Elytharra.~
@238  = ~Fareweeeell, Lady Elytharra. Feh.~
@239  = ~Did I offend you somehow?~
@240  = ~I was just being polite!~
@241  = ~Heh, I bet nobody calls you Lady Salomeya. Well, a woman has to earn this title with proper behavior.~
@242  = ~Salomeya! This was *nothing*, I swear!~
@243  = ~...~
@244  = ~Oh, I am sure she does. These backwater hens are good at hoarding lotions and potions for every ailment. While you are at it, get some leeches for your behind. I have a feeling that you shall need them very soon.~
@245  = ~Why, darling, of course not. I was mute like a stone that was silenced with a spell. Perhaps, I shall clean your ears... after I box them.~
@246  = ~FEH!~
@247  = ~Did you say something, my dear?~
@248  = ~What is it, my Lady Salomeya?~
@249  = ~Will you tell me what is bothering you, or shall I inquire if Lady Elytharra has a coughing draught for sale?~
@250  = ~Yes, unlike some men who lucked out to be born with a noble title of a paladin's drooling whelp.~
@251  = ~Oh, nothing. You can lick the floor with your tongue for this backwater hen for all I care.~
@252  = ~What are you so flustered about? You can lick the floor with your tongue for this backwater hen for all I care.~
@253  = ~This longbow is too good for the likes of them. So, darling, do you think you can aim *anything* well enough to win it for a lady?~
@254  = ~Four gold it is.~
@255  = ~We took a wager from a fellow named Gable at the Palisade.  He bet us that we couldn't knock a barrel from atop its perch on the wall... we'll see about that.~
@256  = ~How about ten gold?~
@257  = ~Twenty gold would sound a lot better to my ears.~
@258  = ~Fifty has a charming ring to it.~
@259  = ~No gold... but how about that longbow you're carrying? My lady fancies it.~
@260  = ~Never mind.  Perhaps some other time.  Farewell.~
@261  = ~Fine.  Ten gold.~
@262  = ~Fine.  Twenty gold.~
@263  = ~Fifty gold.~
@264  = ~Your lady is quite a tart. Too bad you're going to make a fool out of yourself in front of her, heh.~
@265  = ~Well, go on, take all the time you need.  If you knock it from the wall, then you've won.~
@266  = ~Very well.  Stand back.~
@267  = ~Worry not, I'll get Salomeya the trinket she wants.~
@268  = ~Careful, pal. She's not the sort to be called a tart. Now to the barrel.~
@269  = ~My, how you have grown! You can impress a *goblin*.~
@270  = ~Well, at least I can impress a goblin. You on the other hand....~
@271  = ~Heh, a bit more practice, and I can try to impress you!~
@272  = ~Salomeya, why can't you just leave me be?~
@273  = ~I shall pretend that I haven't seen a spark of admiration in your eyes, seeing as you decided to deride rather than compliment me this time around.~
@274  = ~Yes, that is the smallest of my talents, and you are perfectly aware of that. Please, quit this ridiculous charade, Salomeya. I am not going to play along.~
@275  = ~(Laugh.)~
@276  = ~Oh, stop it! Stop it! You're an impossible, uncultured... townie scum! Argh! Look, what you've done to me! I'm quoting a *goblin*!~
@277  = ~Hmph.~
@278  = ~Delusions, delusions...~
@279  = ~You are my song. I too wish that I had other options, but I don't.~
@280  = ~A lot more practice, darling, a whole lot more.~
@281  = ~I can impress whoever I wish, not just pathetic little monsters closest to me in intelligence and appearance!~
@282  = ~I can see why he chose death over wearing those rags. What a smell… feh.~
@283  = ~But you... You are smarter than I credited. (Gives you an interested look.)~
@284  = ~That's nothing. There were certain inconsistencies in his story, so I-~
@285  = ~Really? Does it mean you're starting to like me… a little?~
@286  = ~Oh, my, do I feel flattered!~
@287  = ~That's better! I was starting to get tired of derisive glances and snorts.~
@288  = ~So, do I race you to the inkwell?~
@289  = ~What? You are... you are *laughing* at me?! How... how dare you!~
@290  = ~Why, it's almost endearing.~
@291  = ~I think, I'm going to weep.~
@292  = ~Then I'll talk to you when you're done pretending.~
@293  = ~(A little delicate yawn.) You will have to do better than that to get to me, darling.~
@294  = ~Now, now, don't get too greedy.~
@295  = ~(Quickly, mysteriously, the shade of interest disappears.)~
@296  = ~(Under your breath.) Snake.~
@297  = ~Wait, Salomeya, it was going so well-~
@298  = ~You think that you're the smartest person in town! Well, I have news for you, you are not!~
@299  = ~Very well, we will play your game, for you are made for games. I shall now pretend to be ignited to bigger and better deeds by your brief praise, and its quick withdrawal.~
@300  = ~I can see through your pathetic wiles, Salomeya, and they do not affect me.~
@301  = ~You write your little heart out, if you wish. I am going to see Lord Ulbrec. There can be a reward in this, and I need money. Even that backwater enchantress of his is dressed better than I am!~
@302  = ~As you should be, darling. (Touches your cheek lightly with her lacquered nail.)~
@303  = ~You don't mean to start drooling, do you? Then close your mouth.~
@304  = ~I was standing right here, you dolt. I've seen your limited display of cleverness in all its glory.~
@305  = ~Well, live and learn. They say that a bird can't teach a fish to swim, but here before our very eyes sits proof to the contrary. I suppose that even the old sayings can be wrong.~
@306  = ~They use this ship for scouting? Too bad. It could become a formidable weapon.~
@307  = ~What?! We killed an *avatar*! And now we have to go do purification... What's next? Dusting the whole place?!~
@308  = ~Oh Tymora, I'm so tired of running up and down the stairs... Will it *ever* end?~
@309  = ~By your command, sage Toral.~
@310  = ~We should have taken the avatar's offer. Less bother.~
@311  = ~I cannot wait to see... to feel the restored mythal.~
@312  = ~Ye gods, how tedious is the path of glory at times!~
@313  = ~At long last we are approaching the conclusion of this peculiar experiment. I have never had a chance to work with mythals before. This should prove educational.~
@314  = ~It does be good that this holy and kind man gives us instructions. Otherwise I would be feeling lost. It be too complicated for me.~
@315  = ~If that's going to put an end to the mangy cambions, we'll do it.~
@316  = ~The way he looks at you is dreadful... as if torturing you would satisfy his lust.~
@317  = ~Oh, but it will. This luscious body in my power, screaming at my touch as the pain builds up, and up, and up, culminating in death.~
@318  = ~You will never see it, carrion. I'll kill you for thinking this.~
@319  = ~I strive to fight my battles in cold blood, but this man... this man... Let's KILL HIM!!! (deap breath in)... for the sake of all that is honorable.~
@320  = ~I am glad you are so delighted.  However, I am searching for his red bonds.  I don't suppose you've seen them?~
@321  = ~Oh, for the love of...  I can't take it.  You must die!~
@322  = ~I would love to demonstrate my craft on you - my strong, robust adventurer!~
@323  = ~Fight, fight, fight!!!~
@324  = ~Runnin' into demons is damaging to one's appetite.~
@325  = ~That would have been a perfect manipulation if he had not tried to put a veneer of -what do you surfacers call it?-  noblesse over it. If he'd held back that we'd help him by destroying the demon, he would've benefited without indebting himself. Though some surfacers love to have that hook of doing something *good*. A clever little slave.~
@326  = ~I must take my leave of you.  Farewell.~
@327  = ~You pine for your fellows and seek their deliverance. This is a very unselfish sort of selfish.~
@328  = ~Very well, I shall do so.~
@329  = ~It seems that I have little choice in the matter.~
@330  = ~The North seems to be filled with people who can do nothing to help themselves... perhaps freeing you would do a disservice.~
@331  = ~Hmm, I am starting to understand what the littlest wizard sees in you. To her you actually appear as grand as Lothar does to us.~
@332  = ~A person's grandeur does not be measured by height, but by deeds. The smallest one could raise to greatness.~
@333  = ~Yes, and the ugliest - to beauty?~
@334  = ~It... it be different!~
@335  = ~To the inner beauty, of course, so well-loved by all men. Why, they ever chase after the virtuous!~
@336  = ~<CHARNAME> likes me how I am, so there! (Sticks her tongue out at Salomeya).~
@337  = ~Yes, just like you are, I am sure.~
@338  = ~I wonder what 'Yemen detptos' means? I mean, they keep shouting it all the time! It *must* be important!~
@339  = ~Nothin' good, I'm certain about it, Miss.~
@340  = ~Why don't you ask Nheero? He is well-versed in the yuan-ti's lore.~
@341  = ~Who cares? I've been cursed by my opponents in more tongues than I can count. It comes down to the same thing in the end.~
@342  = ~They all shouted the *same* thing?!~
@343  = ~No. They all died.~
@344  = ~I would have expected them to shout 'Sseth!'. Only, I guess it's kind of tough to shout. It comes out better when you hiss it.~
@345  = ~Considering all the data we have on their faith, it stands to reason that the imitation of the hiss is intentional.~
@346  = ~Perhaps, it's simply the name of their leader.~
@347  = ~Nah, it doesn't sound snaky enough!~
@348  = ~I'm thinking that with their accent, it could be 'Your men're the pots!', meaning chamber pots. To insult us and all that.~
@349  = ~I find it hard to believe that an entire nation could be so annoyingly infantile as to use 'chamber pot' for an insult.~
@350  = ~You should ask the Luskaner to teach you a strong word or two. I'm sure he picked up a few choice ones, despite his father's tender care. And if he didn't... well, don't come and cry on my shoulder when you finally discover that he is a sissy.~
@351  = ~Only a truly low person finds her battle prowess in insulting her enemies. Honor is in defeating a worthy foe.~
@352  = ~Hmm, I wonder if they even use chamber pots though. I can't see them sitting down on them, not with those tails. Hmm, I guess, I'll just have to try to remember to ask Nheero about it. Need to make the man feel useful and all that in his line of work.~
@353  = ~Any research is valuable, and Nheero's might yet prove priceless to the superior races.~
@354  = ~Oh, pleaaaaase!~
@355  = ~Pleasent journeys, heh... we won't find any pleasures here, I can practically guarantee you that!~
@356  = ~Weakling.~
@357  = ~Go to the western portion on the next level - there you'll find a druid named Nathaniel who'll protect you.~
@358  = ~This place is unsafe - perhaps you should go.~
@359  = ~Can you fight?~
@360  = ~You're safe now.  Farewell.~
@361  = ~Well, yeah, compared to that Histachii Transformation!~
@362  = ~Aha, here's my chance to win a growing kingdom, courtesy of Isair, Madae and Bane. How would you like to be a Queen in the North, Salomeya?~
@363  = ~Hmm, a crown of icicles, all the snow you ever wanted and a snow leopard mantle? It's on the smallish side, and more than a little desolate, but it's a start. Go for it, darling.~
@364  = ~You will need to prove your loyalty to me!  All I need is for you to slay ten innocents, and only then shall I accept your allegiance to me as true!  I believe the slaves of Severed Hand will suffice!~
@365  = ~That sounds easy enough.  I'll do it.~
@366  = ~We accepted an alliance with Iyachtu Xvim, with his vow that his demons within the Severed Hand will not aid Isair and Madae when we combat them.  However, in order to prove our allegiance to the Lord of Darkness, we must slay ten innocents.  He then told us that ten slaves within the Severed Hand would suffice.  A simple task, we believe.~
@367  = ~I already did away with at least ten slaves, so I believe I have met your requirements.~
@368  = ~I will see you destroyed before I kill innocents!~
@369  = ~Ah, pretty, pretty stone, you're ours. Though who's to say that it... uhm... works as advertised? Shouldn't havin' it prevented us from takin' exactly this sort of rash actions?~
@370  = ~Why, of course. Who'd want to get close to that thing anyway? If you'd invented a device that spits out drow jewelery, not driders then - Uhm... pardon my daydreamin'.~
@371  = ~Amiable and honorable. We're grateful for the warning you gave us.~
@372  = ~When spiders unite they can tie down a lion. I fear that recruiting among the most desperate and bitter is a clever strategy for the Legion. Men will do for vengeance far more than they'd do for gold, and it does not run out.~
@373  = ~Why did the driders form this alliance?~
@374  = ~So, you want us to clear out the driders?~
@375  = ~Now I understand why Nym wanted us to come through here...~
@376  = ~Be careful. Those who sleep with dogs will rise with fleas.~
@377  = ~Very well.~
@378  = ~Do you *promise* not to harm us?~
@379  = ~We refuse.~
@380  = ~A real priestess of Lolth?! The day... or whatever it is on the surface, gets better and better! Aren't you glad we finally left that boring monastery behind?~
@381  = ~If it's not wet, it's not water. (Sighs) A perfect welcome to the Underdark judging from the tales I've heard.~
@382  = ~(Yawn) How the time flies when one is having 'fun'... Good thing they didn't think of creating Twenty Chambers!~
@383  = ~Go on...~
@384  = ~No need? The mercenary must always play at battles to win the real ones. We belong here, Weapon Master.~
@385  = ~I wanted to ask about Sersa.~
@386  = ~I had some questions.~
@387  = ~Farewell, then.~
@388  = ~It is said that an army of sheep led by a lion would defeat an army of lions led by a sheep. With the Legion's influence growing we owe it to the Ten Towns to make sure that the leader here is a lion.~
@389  = ~Wait - the "Eight Chambers?"~
@390  = ~Salisam explained to us that, if we found a way to remove Aruma from power, he'll allow us to face the Eight Chambers in an effort to become associates of the monastery.  When that's done, we'll be allowed access to the Underdark passage.  Salisam suggested that Aruma's turning against the archimandrite has something to do with Dolon Daemba, the envoy from Isair and Madae - that he's somehow corrupted her.  In any case, we're forbidden from attacking both Aruma and Dolon or speaking of Salisam's offer to anyone else - should we do either, the offer is negated.~
@391  = ~Wow, did you hear that? A 'cutter', and 'barmy nutters'... That's a real Sigilian for you! No wonder Aruma fell for the man! (Sigh.)~
@392  = ~Farewell, Dolon.~
@393  = ~Hey, Peony, I don't like the way you look at this man! And sigh!~
@394  = ~Oh, so just being a tiefling is not enough! One has to be from Sigil?~
@395  = ~So you liked the fiend-bloods?~
@396  = ~(Giggle.) You're so cute when you are jealous! Listen, just because I approve of the girl's taste doesn't mean I'm after her lad. All right?~
@397  = ~I'll still be glad to see his back. Get going, you lover-boy.~
@398  = ~Nope! There's plenty charm to a tiefling who's *not* Sigil-born! And you're too cute when you are jealous!~
@399  = ~What girl doesn't?! But hey, I'm glad that you're an aasimar. Same charm, but waaaay nicer. They say tieflings are so hot that they burn the arms that hold them. Yep, I sure don't want to be burned!~
@400  = ~It's almost pleasant to not be singled out.~
@401  = ~Die, savage!~
@402  = ~Are you Guthma, the leader of this fortress?~
@403  = ~Do you think we just walked in?  There's a trail of bodies behind us.~
@404  = ~SAVAGE?! I WILL BE REMEMBERED AS THE LEADER OF THE ARMY THAT RID THE NORTH OF MAN. But you - YOU WILL DIE!~ [GUTHM010]
@405  = ~It takes a morally superior being to resolve a dispute between the two immature rogues. But would not justice have been served better if they devoured one another? Or did the universal balance require both to live a little longer? Fortunately, I have time to ponder these questions as we backtrack.~
@406  = ~Thank you.  But, before I go, can you tell me what the message says?~
@407  = ~We were able to find a peaceful solution to Kruntur and Yquog's feud.  Everyone got what they requested and no blood was shed.  In the process, we were able to ascertain some kind of demonic connection between the so-called masters of this horde.~
@408  = ~Farewell.~
@409  = ~The bracers that we found on Yquog's body evidently belonged to Kruntur's dead brother.  We gave them back to Kruntur.~
@410  = ~You know, others might complain, but I enjoy this respite from violence. It reminds me of my trade, runnin' there and back, tradin' goods. Ah, yes, wonderful times....~
@411  = ~Not too small for me! Uhm, though, of course, we need to return them to Kruntur, and then come back for *another* reward. Yep, that's what we will most certainly do.~
@412  = ~Well... uh, I'll go take these bracers to Kruntur.  I shall return.~
@413  = ~This is rapidly becoming more trouble than it's worth. Killing them will save us both time and running around in circles.~
@414  = ~So what do I get for being *your* errand-boy?~
@415  = ~You know, I've played courier far too many times recently, and this is where I draw the line!  ~
@416  = ~Fine. I'll kill the lot of you then and feed your flesh to my clan.~
@417  = ~I haven't had the time to contemplate this until now, but what if the choice of password is not accidental? Xvim is a dangerous entity, a demonic son of Bane. I don't like where this train of thought is heading.~
@418  = ~And they say 'tis always a joy to feed the hungry.~
@419  = ~I brought you another spider.~
@420  = ~I brought you some more spiders.~
@421  = ~Here you go, a spider carcass that is quite a bit bigger than the rest.~
@422  = ~Can I rest here?~
@423  = ~Die, scum!~
@424  = ~Me don't want to die!~
@425  = ~A dagger is a backstabber's weapon to start with, and to coat it with poison doubles the dishonor.~
@426  = ~Pooh on dishonor, girl. Inefficiency, this is what ticks me off. Really, a venomous dagger against spiders! That is the pinnacle of self-assurance, running towards a spider, yelling: "I'm going to poison you!"~
@427  = ~Why not? They say that the snakes can die of their own poisons.~
@428  = ~Hmm, my situation is looking better and better by the moment.~
@429  = ~Get to the point.~
@430  = ~Stop!  You are just too vile to let live.  Die, beast!~
@431  = ~Fine, be that way, fleshy mortal. You should make a fine meal.~
@432  = ~I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't want to kill him. At least he does not try to kill us for food. Besides, look at our other opponents: Torak of the Broken Tusk Clan, Caballus the Sorcerer.... And now Pondmuk the Hungry? Phew.~
@433  = ~So you want to make a deal?~
@434  = ~You're hungry?~
@435  = ~Why are you alone here, Pondmuk?~
@436  = ~Me don't want to die. Me hungry!~
@437  = ~I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. I've not previously met a goblin that took the time to ponder his life and obligations.~
@438  = ~I bet you *anything* against a scroll with the 'Charm Potted Plants' spell she's in love with him!~
@439  = ~Then you're doubly pathetic.~
@440  = ~That's a good idea.~
@441  = ~More than you did for your boyfriend.~
@442  = ~I don't really need your help, I've got enough information already.  Farewell.~
@443  = ~In the Underdark this drumming would have attracted unwanted attention, rather than help. Only a fool makes noise there.~
@444  = ~Some like putting names to the corpses of their slain enemies, but I'm ambivalent about it. Let's be done with the useless introductions and let the blades talk.~
@445  = ~What is there to talk about?~
@446  = ~Legion?  What Legion are you talking about?~
@447  = ~Now that our blades are at your throat, you seek to negotiate?  Your skills in diplomacy are sorely lacking, Xuki... if you even seek to bargain, which I doubt.~
@448  = ~We spoke to a mage named Xuki at the caravan bridge.  She wanted to parley, but we would have nothing of it.~
@449  = ~Parley?  You're bluffing... you seek to deceive us, to buy time, don't you?~
@450  = ~We will not bargain with you, Xuki.  We will drive you from Shaengarne once and for all.~
@451  = ~We shall see about that.~
@452  = ~Oops. What?! I *told* you, I was going to say that!~
@453  = ~Lord Ulbrec heard of the destruction of Shaengarne Bridge, and he has determined that only if an offensive is mounted quickly can Targos hope to break the goblin horde before they strike the town again.  He has asked us to meet two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston, south and east of Targos and give them whatever aid they require to break the goblins' strength in the region.~
@454  = ~So, what are we going to tell Ulbrec?~
@455  = ~Aha, I know! 'Oops'. (Giggles.)~
@456  = ~Sneaking through the backdoor, aren't we? Tee-hee!~
@457  = ~Here, now even grandma can't say that eavesdropping is all that bad!~
@458  = ~Seems to me the bridge we fixed a while back wasn't in much worse condition. I'm sure Neverwinter troops can mend this un'. Or go on ice, or whatever.~
@459  = ~No burning the bridges behind you, Xuki!~
@460  = ~It's no use crying over spilt milk. Let's return to Targos on the double to do what we still can to aid them.~
@461  = ~It's good to see the town still standing.~
@462  = ~Despite the less than warm reception I'm glad to breathe fresh air again! By Lathander, those warrens stank!~
@463  = ~Tough as nails, that one!~
@464  = ~This place is just like a traveling menagerie, only better. Well, apart from killing all the animals. But you can see them real close, and there are no stupid cages!~
@465  = ~Shawford with his crane, Ulbrec with his bridge, orcs with their dam. Dwarven lumberjacks are what Targos needs, not fighting men.~
@466  = ~Gaernat Sharptooth? Should've been 'Yellowtooth'. Yikes. Do you *ever* clean your chompers?~
@467  = ~I sharpen them regularly, my sweet, on the bones of my victims. Gnome collar bones are particularly fine.~
@468  = ~You do not rule me, Gaernat.  I will not bow to you.~
@469  = ~If I ever entertained the idea, it's now gone. I will not bow to you.~
@470  = ~Lord over your rats, bastard. You scared the girl, and I won't let it pass. Bowing, ha!~
@471  = ~I have come to remove you from the pass.  Not to bow to you.~
@472  = ~We met Gaernat Sharptooth, a wererat, in Shaengarne Pass.  He claimed to be the ruler of the pass and any who dwelled within.~
@473  = ~I wouldn't depend on his word that it's the *final* battle, Master. Me bringing you his head, on the other hand, guarantees it.~
@474  = ~I wouldn't depend on his word that it's the *final* battle, Mistress. Me bringing you his head, on the other hand, guarantees it.~
@475  = ~Ha! They have a drow. A drow is nothing that the Broken Tusk Clan can't break!~
@476  = ~And? Ah, yes. He thinks we care what he does to some woodcutters with neither kin nor power. Well, Master, are you a trembling surfacer, or have you the right?~
@477  = ~I swear upon my honor as a paladin that no harm shall come to you or your people, Kaitlin.~
@478  = ~We met a woman named Kaitlin in the ruins of a logging village.  She said that Torak sent her to us with an ultimatum.  We are not to approach his camp, or he will slay the villagers that he holds as hostage.~
@479  = ~Who are you?~
@480  = ~Tell me, Kaitlin.  How can I help you?~
@481  = ~Where can I find Torak?~
@482  = ~Why should I care about the lives of a few peasants?~
@483  = ~And? Ah, yes. He thinks we care what he does to some woodcutters with neither kin nor power. Well, Mistress, are you a trembling surfacer, or have you the right?~
@484  = ~Oi, I don't think grandma would have approved of this. Or Lady Alustriel. Most especially Lady Alustriel. Oh, well. Life goes on.~
@485  = ~I guess this is what grandma meant when she said that good deeds leave one feeling warm and fuzzy inside. Or maybe it's the rush of blood because of the battle and all.~
@486  = ~This will weigh heavily on my soul until my dying day.~
@487  = ~Lathander's blessing on us for saving these men and women.~
@488  = ~Look, the orcs have grown brains.~
@489  = ~Do you know where this lookout can be found?~
@490  = ~Just how is it that you know this?~
@491  = ~Even orcs can explode their own while barely singeing their enemy's cloaks only so many times before realizing that there is a better way. Do you know where this lookout can be found, Sabrina?~
@492  = ~They say bad news come in threes, but here is the good news in two. We killed some orcs, and freed a good man.~
@493  = ~It is my pleasure to aid you, Dereth.~
@494  = ~Your rescue was unintentional.  I was simply slaying some orcs.~
@495  = ~It is a pleasure to be of service to a fellow druid, Dereth.~
@496  = ~Hey, thanks! I mean for wishing us to enjoy our time, not to die. Because I'm definitely not going to.~
@497  = ~You are.~
@498  = ~No, I'm not!~
@499  = ~You ARE!~
@500  = ~Nope, nope, nope!~
@501  = ~Yes, yes... Argh! Stupid gnome, you'll die first!~
@502  = ~We shall see who is to die and in which order!~
@503  = ~Maybe, but not by *your* hairy hand.~
@504  = ~That's it! You've awoken my terrible wrath by threatening this beautiful girl!~
@505  = ~You were so marvelous and manly when you said all those things to Torak. Just wow!~
@506  = ~And you said I'm beautiful! (Giggle.)~
@507  = ~I'm glad that I joined you, because surely nobody can now fault me for leaving Luskan. I am still working on ensuring the safe passage of our troops.~
@508  = ~They must be fletched with phoenix feathers, these arrows. Ah, I wish this woman ran my shop back in Waterdeep.~
@509  = ~Fifty gold?  That's nothing... and here I was thinking you were going to bleed me dry.~
@510  = ~Hmm.  I don't have that much - I will return when I do.~
@511  = ~Actually, maybe I better sell some things to you first to raise the gold I need.~
@512  = ~And what makes you think that the lady would welcome such 'personal' thanks?~
@513  = ~Uh... well, Isherwood, you're a nice guy and all, but I just like you as a friend, not-~
@514  = ~Actually, seeing as nobody else is offering-~
@515  = ~I don't think he is a local purveyor of sensual delights, Jaemal.~
@516  = ~I see that chivalry is not yet dead. (You thank Jaemal with a bright glance.)~
@517  = ~This surfacer seems to think he has a smooth way around powerful females. Quite droll, since he's about as smooth as an Earth elemental in a chapel.~
@518  = ~Thanks - these flasks should prove helpful.  Farewell, Isherwood.~
@519  = ~I agree with you, Rizdaer. It's fortunate for him that he knows when to back off!~
@520  = ~And you know all about pleasing a woman, of course. Thanks for that Burning Oil of Desire, Isherwood.~
@521  = ~I hope you won't meet me there. I yearn for the final Release, not yet another life, another burden.~
@522  = ~Farewell, Veira.~
@523  = ~They seem to be in good spirits. It bodes well for the town under siege.~
@524  = ~The smug-lookin' one? Would it be that it were full of good mead....~
@525  = ~That's just so mean! (Giggle)~
@526  = ~Fetching wood? This task reminds me of my days as a farm hand.~
@527  = ~We met with Shawford Crale, commander of the Targos Guard.  He told us to speak to Olap Tamewater, a dwarven engineer assigned to the Palisade and give him whatever assistance is required.~
@528  = ~Wow, someone else from Silverymoon. Fancy that!~
@529  = ~Yes.  We recently arrived from Luskan.~
@530  = ~We've come to spill a little goblin blood and man the city walls, yes.~
@531  = ~The letter was entrusted to me, and I will not release it for the sake of satisfying someone's idle curiosity. You must give a very good reason for me to grant your request.~
@532  = ~I know Captain Mariner, Garrad. I can deliver the letter. ~
@533  = ~That must be awfully nice. But it never happens to me. Someone comes upon me, and whoop! All the ideas I had in my head disappear I don't know where. Hi. I'm Peony!~
@534  = ~I did my part arranging the transports, but I'm afraid I can't give you good news. The last I've heard there were some delays and changes of plans.~
@535  = ~Can you tell me anything else about the goblin raiders?~
@536  = ~What happened to the scouts you sent to find the goblin encampment?~
@537  = ~Can you tell me anything about that airship on the northern side of town?~
@538  = ~What were your orders again?~
@539  = ~This woman needs to control her emotions, instead of letting them control her.~
@540  = ~Actually, we have come with a requisition for more arrows at the Palisade.~
@541  = ~There's a goblin attack taking place on the docks - we are looking for Targos soldiers to aid us.~
@542  = ~What is this place?~
@543  = ~Actually, I've come to purchase supplies.~
@544  = ~Priests have a way of turning everything into their god's business.~
@545  = ~Why would anyone voluntarily call those drunken rogues brothers? Though here I am at a loss as to who discredits whom.~
@546  = ~Oh, spo-o-o-oky!~
@547  = ~Aha, here it is. This healing brew is just the right thing for the good soldier by the pier.~
@548  = ~Oi. She's so much like grandma in some ways, it's eerie! Apart from the fact that grandma never raises her voice. Only everyone jumps anyway when she says 'frog'.~
@549  = ~We're *not* robbers.  We just sailed in on the Wicked Wench to aid Targos.~
@550  = ~It wasn't until we mentioned Hedron's ship, the Wicked Wench, by name that the old woman we saved ceased her howling and reluctantly admitted we might be telling the truth about us coming to help her.  She told us to go back to Hedron and tell him she was safe.  Oddly enough, Firtha mentioned that she was blind, which is strange, because she seemed to see us quite clearly.~
@551  = ~Look, you filthy banshee, enough of your howling, or we WILL rob you.~
@552  = ~Is *this* the thanks you offer to those who saved your life?  We come to your aid, and you repay us with threats?!~
@553  = ~Please - calm down, we just had some questions.~
@554  = ~I will take my leave, then.  Farewell.~
@555  = ~This fool is asking for a dagger through his tongue.~
@556  = ~How drunk a man must be to confuse a woman every inch a lady with a tavern maid?!~
@557  = ~Now, that's what I wish I were doin', if I have to risk my dear life.~
@558  = ~I've never seen a purple dragon
I never hope to see one
But I can tell you anyhow
I'd rather see than be one!~
@559  = ~Nope, we haven't seen any battle, and we won't *ever* if you keep blocking the view!~
@560  = ~Let me in that warehouse, and you'll see how good we play at being soldiers.~
@561  = ~We convinced Brogan to let us drive the goblins out of the warehouse.  He told us they had locked themselves inside, and we'd need to break down the door to the warehouse with our weapons, or else we'd need to get a thief to pick the lock.~
@562  = ~Where's the Salty Dog Tavern?  I could go find those sell-swords you're waiting for and bring them here.~
@563  = ~Where's the Salty Dog Tavern again?  I could go find those sell-swords you're waiting for and bring them here.~
@564  = ~I'll go grab the Iron Collar company from the Salty Dog, and perhaps between the three groups of us we can dispatch these goblins.~
@565  = ~We told Brogan we would go find the Iron Collar mercenaries... they're holed up in a tavern called the Salty Dog somewhere south along the docks.~
@566  = ~But the Iron Collar mercenaries might not be able to get here in time.~
@567  = ~If you want soldiers, then you shouldn't be waiting for those Iron Collar drunks - if you want those goblins dead, then talk to *me.*~
@568  = ~Luskan thief blood? Why, but that's an insult in so many ways! I'll have you know that I specialize in openin' locks for the most respectable reasons.~
@569  = ~Let's hold on the insults for now. How many do you figure are in the warehouse, Brogan?~
@570  = ~All right, all right. Let's just open the door already.~
@571  = ~You'll need to see him regardless, I wager, to get rid of that villain the priests saddled ye with. Between us, I can't reckon why you didn't push him overboard, quiet-like. Less bother.~
@572  = ~That explains all the 'friendly' shoves I got from the crew.~
@573  = ~Where can I find Lord Ulbrec?~
@574  = ~Hedron Kerdos, the captain of the Wicked Wench, has dropped our party off on the docks of Targos.  He told us to seek out Ulbrec Dinnsmore, the Lord of Targos, in the town above the cliffs and warned us to be wary of goblin raiders in the region.~
@575  = ~Staffs, swords, arrows. So many in these parts underestimate the power of the body and mind. No, I have all I need to fight and win, my own fists and toes.~
@576  = ~Thanks for the blade - but we could also use some armor if we're going to be hunting goblins.~
@577  = ~Very well.  How did the goblins get into town?~
@578  = ~What's wrong with your arm?~
@579  = ~Your arm appears to be in pretty bad shape - your bandages are almost soaked through.~
@580  = ~And what toes! One well aimed hit of this pinkie, and a man can be left without heirs.  ~
@581  = ~Come the dawn, all things may be healed, Lathander teaches us.  A potion is something we can find later, after I have stopped the bleeding with a curative spell.~
@582  = ~A black dog doesn't get any whiter with washing. Why am I not surprised in the least that the Hosttower would work against its city's official policy?~
@583  = ~How do you know my name?~
@584  = ~How did you find me?~
@585  = ~Harshom claims to have found us through the aid of Carita and Leevi.  The couple was slain and fed to the enchanter's beasts after they'd told him everything.~
@586  = ~The Hosttower?~
@587  = ~Enough boasting, Harshom - it's time to fight.~
@588  = ~I think it was pretty funny! Of course some people are too stupid or full of themselves to appreciate a good joke.~
@589  = ~Yes, but... "war-bears?"~
@590  = ~What's the Hosttower?~
@591  = ~With pleasure. My beasts are growing restless.~
@592  = ~Didn't I tell you all duergar were scum? Well, enough said. Let's fight our way out of this ambush.~
@593  = ~Wait - how did you get here, behind us?~
@594  = ~We'll see about that.~
@595  = ~Outsider, prepare to behold our tremendous skill in battle.~
@596  = ~Without mercy and pity, there can be no strength.~
@597  = ~We believe otherwise, as Laduguer taught us.~
@598  = ~(When we go through the monastery we *must* warn the monks! Only... wouldn't it be dishonorable to betray this dwarf's confidence? I... I must meditate on this dilemma.)~
@599  = ~Barud told us that he intends to make the duergar complex a base from which to assault the Black Raven Monastery in conjunction with a second body of duergar troops.~
@600  = ~Barud told us that, now that we've helped him clear the river caves and eliminated the monks of Black Raven Monastery, he would be joining with a second body of duergar troops and reclaiming the Underdark passage.~
@601  = ~One moment - "become as shadows?"~
@602  = ~According to Barud Barzam, all duergar possess the ability to become invisible at will.~
@603  = ~Wait - I had other questions.~
@604  = ~Never mind.  Farewell.~
@605  = ~As much as I hate turning a blind eye on the evil goings-on, I think it will be for the best if we heed this warning.~
@606  = ~I hate duergar scum.~
@607  = ~Stupidity, courage, whatever. The outcome will be one and the same for you. Death.~
@608  = ~Eh?  Ha... ha-ha... BWAAAH-HAH-HAH-HAH!~
@609  = ~At least you will die laughing.~
@610  = ~By the great ravens, I probably will, but not before I live out fifty more glorious years of conquest and slaughter!~
@611  = ~This place starts to unnerve me. Good and ill - it all seems to revolve around trifling with death. Not that I blame Venla for returning the corpses back to life, but... Let's be away from here before the Fell Forest marks us like it marked this village.~
@612  = ~I don't trust this drow an inch, but we indeed must hurry. Time waits on no <MANWOMAN>.~
@613  = ~Wait - I have more questions.~
@614  = ~The drow merchant Nym left the village, but not before issuing a vague warning about the Legion of the Chimera knowing of our meddling and taking pains to stop us.  He suggested that we not remain there long.~
@615  = ~Farewell, Nym.~
@616  = ~Just say the word, Mistress, and I'll slay the pathetic male who dared to displease you.~
@617  = ~I think Tahvo simply omitted the obvious, my shining friend.~
@618  = ~My poor dear, you're reduced to begging for compliments from strangers. I think I'll have to do something about that... perhaps.~
@619  = ~Hey, we used to play a game just like that, only much smaller when we were kids. It was even called 'stones'! I wish all the barbarians were as much fun as these ones.~
@620  = ~I don't know how he missed that one! You're the epitome of all things rugged and handsome. Well, at least I think so.~
@621  = ~Some girls I know just want every man to trail them like a puppy telling them how beautiful they are and all that. Right, Rizdaer? Er... Rizdaer?~
@622  = ~A thing of beauty! Uhm, I wonder if the spirit'd be satisfied with having the thief slain...~
@623  = ~A gem-encr- ... Er... pardon me kindly, sir, but could you pinpoint the exact date of your death, and perchance sign a scroll if I recorded your admittedly sad story-~
@624  = ~Scroll? Writing?! Are you trying to trick me into something with the devious magic of lettering? Spoken words are good enough for honest people.~
@625  = ~Perhaps... uh... perhaps another time, then.~
@626  = ~Nikosh, Nikosh. Here, I found this on a thief's corpse.  Take your horn, spirit.~
@627  = ~We found the barrow wight's stolen drinking horn on a thief's corpse in the woods east of the village.  We returned it to Sordirsin - his spirit was grateful and left with the horn, claiming that we could take whatever we liked from his now-vacant tomb.~
@628  = ~If I honored you with a song, chieftain of old, could you rest in peace once more?~
@629  = ~It sounds nice.  But If I did have it, I wouldn't return it to a withered corpse like you.~
@630  = ~I stole nothing from you, spirit.  Farewell.~
@631  = ~'Tis outrageous! We can't let the valuable antique remain in the hands of some uneducated bandits. Hmm, to think on it, the chieftain doesn't deserve it either... I wonder if the spirit laid to rest once would arise again, if- Uhm, sorry, I drifted off. ~
@632  = ~I had other questions.~
@633  = ~Thanks, Pairi.  Farewell.~
@634  = ~Cheer up, killing the white wolves isn't as difficult as all that. See, they don't leap at you, they stop dead in their tracks, and try to blow some snow your way. And that's when you hit them with a fireball real quick! Kaboom! And they are dead!~
@635  = ~I... thank you for the advice, but I'm not a great mage either, like yourself.~
@636  = ~Tee-hee, now I know why that Anja girl must like you! Why don't I just kill a darn wolf for you then?~
@637  = ~You could do that? The skin will probably be enough to impress Anja's father.~
@638  = ~I have a pelt from one of those beasts.~
@639  = ~I see.  What can you tell me about this area?~
@640  = ~I must go... farewell, Jari.~
@641  = ~So, pirate, if someone's old pa wanted you to kill a wolf... Nah, that's too easy. If someone's old pa wanted you to kill a dragon, would you have done it?~
@642  = ~If that someone was as pretty and sweet as you are - in a flash!~
@643  = ~Nah, I'll just stand in the middle of the town square and whine until another beauty shows up and brings the dragon-head back to me. Seems to work for this lad.~
@644  = ~No. Not because I couldn't do it, but because I resent stupid contests. I'd have abducted my maid instead putting both her father and my rivals to shame.~
@645  = ~You're phantasmagoric!~
@646  = ~I wish I was as brave as the young lord here.~
@647  = ~Oh, don't feel bad. Not many can claim to be his equal! Oh, almost forgot! If I were to help you, how are you going to keep your Anja if you are a lousy hunter? She won't end up miserable?~
@648  = ~I'm good at fishing and hunting small fare. Rabbits, minks and the like.~
@649  = ~Aha.~
@650  = ~Well, the long story short, we already have a pelt from one of those beasts.~
@651  = ~It settled then.  What can you tell me about this area, Jari?~
@652  = ~Peony, we must go... farewell, Jari.~
@653  = ~Oh, don't be so mean! Not everyone can be as brave as you are!~
@654  = ~Don't feel bad, Jari. Not many can claim to be his equal! Oh, almost forgot! If I were to help you, how are you going to keep your Anja if you are a lousy hunter? She won't end up miserable?~
@655  = ~Let's see what these hunters consider skilled and ferocious. But I doubt that it will make for an interesting kill.~
@656  = ~Actually, it's gone - we appeased it.~
@657  = ~We told Tahvo that we'd appeased the barrow wight.  We should let Suoma the Elder know.~
@658  = ~It sounds like a barrow wight.  Perhaps someone's stolen from it...?~
@659  = ~Based on Tahvo's information about their "furious ghost," it sounds as if the creature is a wight of some sort.  Perhaps someone stole something from its barrow - that would explain why it has come back to life and is attacking people.~
@660  = ~I see.  I had some other questions.~
@661  = ~All right.  I wanted to purchase equipment.~
@662  = ~I'll see what I can do.  Farewell.~
@663  = ~What's dead can never die, but with Lathander's blessing we could perhaps return the abomination to death from its unlife.~
@664  = ~Do you know anything more about it?~
@665  = ~I see.  I had some questions, Tahvo.~
@666  = ~They've come back? Wonderful news! I was worried that while we fought they'd run right into Limha's monsters or barbarians.~
@667  = ~Of course... no thanks necessary.~
@668  = ~We went to Venla the Healer after defeating the diabolical witch Limha and freeing the village's children from her wicked grasp.  We should let Suoma the Elder know.~
@669  = ~Your kind words will buy me nothing.  What about a reward?~
@670  = ~Of course.  Farewell.~
@671  = ~I'm so proud of you, Northern Light. You could have told the truth, and we would have killed them. But you let them go. I... I admire you.~
@672  = ~I paid a debt. Some village children saved me, so I saved these ones.~
@673  = ~Mistress, I beg of you, stop doing things like that. We could have killed those men easily, and you let them go. And with a vendetta in the making against you.~
@674  = ~The only life that's at stake is yours. You forsook it when you said that children go free when you're dead. We were hired to bring the brats home, and that's what's going to happen. ~
@675  = ~What you're doing is wrong, Limha.  You must be stopped.~
@676  = ~Rizdaer is right. We've a job to do, and you're in our way.~
@677  = ~I've seen all sorts of evil try to pass their crimes for benevolent deeds, but this must be the most outrageous lie I have heard! And she tells it as if she believes in it too.~
@678  = ~Except for the children you destroy.~
@679  = ~Perhaps the village might want to defend itself rather than have you kill its children.~
@680  = ~That's a child? How big is he going to be when he grows up?!~
@681  = ~By Lathander's light, it's not for greed but out of need that Suoma indentured us. I will not complain about rescuing children.~
@682  = ~Are there any clues as to what happened?~
@683  = ~When we asked Venla if there were any clues about the village's missing children, she said that their best hunters have searched everywhere and found no trace of them.  Some of the villagers feel that the children were lost in the Fell Wood to the east, having fallen prey to some "fey creature" like a dryad or nymph.~
@684  = ~Let me ask about something else.~
@685  = ~I'll return if I find something out.  Farewell.~
@686  = ~Psst, he seems to say that to every girl he meets.~
@687  = ~You seem different from the other villagers.  Why is that?~
@688  = ~Farewell, Pairi.~
@689  = ~Well, have fun waiting. *I* am not letting him out of my sight!~
@690  = ~You seem different from the other villagers.~
@691  = ~Eyes like fire? Nah. Mine are... Chromatic Orbs!~
@692  = ~And you think we're those strangers...~
@693  = ~Suoma, the elder of Wandering Village, has asked that we speak with and help Venla the Healer.  She claims that if we aid the village, she will aid us in turn, telling us the way through the haunted Fell Wood to the east.~
@694  = ~I don't have time for this.  Farewell.~
@695  = ~Your eyes are more beautiful than any spells, Peony! They sparkle! Er... sorry, Elder, I got distracted.~
@696  = ~I understand that an old woman such as I cannot compete for your attention with this maiden, but I implore you to listen to me.~
@697  = ~I am. You think we are these strangers.~
@698  = ~I suggest we write 'Here lies Fara' on her tombstone. She'll be rolling in that frozen grave of hers like a spindle till the end of time.~
@699  = ~I didn't think that you possessed wickedness enough to want to condemn a defeated foe to eternal torment.~
@700  = ~Fine, let's honorably leave her body to the crows and wolves like all the rest.~
@701  = ~Do you think I'm just going to stand here listening to you making my own funeral arrangements?!~
@702  = ~Certainly. One should enjoy the last moments of her life.~
@703  = ~I'm glad I accomodated you.~
@704  = ~You'll run off if you know what's good for you, giant... we're not leaving anyone here alive.~
@705  = ~We'll see who the idiots are when the battle is over, Thvara.~
@706  = ~It seems they are scraping the bottom of the barrel for reinforcements just like the humans in Targos.~
@707  = ~If you're so eager to join your sisters in the arms of your uncaring goddess, so be it.~
@708  = ~Your naive confidence in your strength - and that of your "goddess" - delights me.  Let's see you praise Auril when you're bleeding in the snow, heretic.~
@709  = ~You can't succeed... go, while you still can.~
@710  = ~We encountered a cleric of Auril named Thvara Baelm.  It seems that while we were doing battle in the Western Pass glacier, she was gathering barbarian recruits in the east.  Our paths happened to cross as we made for the Eastern Pass and she was returning with a number of barbarians in tow.  Needless to say, the situation degenerated rapidly.~
@711  = ~We've just taken out an entire temple - including your superiors - and you think you can stop us with some ratty barbarians and a moronic giant?  Just leave in peace.~
@712  = ~So be it.~
@713  = ~You built this whole palace?! Alone?! In a day?! Oh, wow, wow, wow!~
@714  = ~Lysara mentioned you.  Why'd you build this temple for her?~
@715  = ~You built this temple?  In a day?~
@716  = ~You built this temple?  Then you'll die for the trouble you and your Aurilites have caused!~
@717  = ~Yes, we know all about you - "arch-architect - honored guest - former lover of Oria."   You'll die for the trouble you and your Aurilites have caused!~
@718  = ~Well met.  Farewell.~
@719  = ~Run for the hills, Sleeping Beauty. The insipid gnome is about to put you on her list of heroes. You'll shine there in the choice company of her grandma and Lady Alustriel. Hmm, you are certainly good-looking when awake.~
@720  = ~Holy sisters that reign in the name of their goddess... It brings back memories. Bad memories.~
@721  = ~Where's the rest of the Neverwinter militia?  We were to meet with them.~
@722  = ~Here's one of your kind.~
@723  = ~I don't believe I have much in common with this priestess or her aspiration to cover the world in everlasting winter.~
@724  = ~Well, you speak just like that sometimes. So a normal person knows all the words, but can't quite grasp what are you going on and on and on about. It's kind of irritating.~
@725  = ~I... I apologize. I find that people here have no less sharp minds than those of my homeland, but it seems that their inner self is attuned to a different melody of being.~
@726  = ~See, that's exactly what I mean. 'Thy words float from me like snow in the wind.' Tee-hee!~
@727  = ~Hey, don't you dare berate Oswald! He is every kind of competent!~
@728  = ~Did you create this glacier?~
@729  = ~Did you create this temple?~
@730  = ~What's happening here?~
@731  = ~What have you done to this area to make the air colder and the ice unbreakable?~
@732  = ~Are you working with the Legion of the Chimera?~
@733  = ~Are you working with Isair and Madae?~
@734  = ~I can't allow you to continue sacrificing innocent people to your evil goddess.  This ends now!~
@735  = ~I've heard enough!  It's time for you to die!~
@736  = ~Yes, I'll kneel before you.~
@737  = ~I think this is how one feels before stepping over the threshold of immortality and into the final Release. We vanquished many enemies, but she is the first one I saw pass through the gates of Death.~
@738  = ~Bah. A child's toy.~
@739  = ~It's very poetic of course, but goodness is on our side. I feel that you are the spirit of evil that poisoned your sisters. For that and other crimes committed here, you shall answer. The victory shall be ours, with Lathander's blessing.~
@740  = ~Ha! Soon you'll answer for yours against my Temple and the Snow Queen!~
@741  = ~Thank you kindly, my good sir, 'tis indeed a timely offer. Ah, what I wouldn't give now to uncurl my toes by a warm fire, sipping ale from a lovely full tankard!~
@742  = ~I don't care much for cities, but thanks just the same.~
@743  = ~The offer is appreciated, though I'd prefer the coin went to my church rather than an alehouse.~
@744  = ~Aye!  So long as it's good dwarven stout, ye're on.~
@745  = ~Sounds good... we'll hold you to it, Rahm.~
@746  = ~There's no need - we're hired swords, not heroes.~
@747  = ~We just might take you up on that.~
@748  = ~In other words, we should have asked who aren't your enemies. There are gods blinded by their hatreds in this world, and Auril is among the worst.~
@749  = ~Lysan?~
@750  = ~It's time for you to die!~
@751  = ~So much for 'no more bloodshed'! Unless the 'last wishes' doesn't mean 'I'm going to kill you NOW!' anymore?~
@752  = ~What's going on here?~
@753  = ~As far as I know, it still means that same old thing. So, have you any last wishes, priestess?!~
@754  = ~There is but one Queen here, and that's my sweet lady. The confused one.~
@755  = ~The man you were in life might have commanded my respect. Now you are but a horrid abomination!~
@756  = ~I am neither blind to my current station, nor deaf for you to shout your insults. In the age of glory we respected our adversaries, but now... Now I shall have to test my blade and my prowess against yours regardless.~
@757  = ~Indeed.~
@758  = ~Thank you. Really, who else could have had belladonna if not another adventurous gnome? Oswald and him are like peas in a pod!~
@759  = ~Thank you.  Farewell.~
@760  = ~Cleric of B-W *and* an illusionist? That old foggy B-W does not complain that you're spreading yourself thin?~
@761  = ~No, because he's under the impression that I'm not.~

@763  = ~Not so much an illusion, as careful persuasion, though you might be onto something here! But I'm sorry... Aocha! Aocha!~
@764  = ~If you're Zack, then this must be your note.~
@765  = ~Aocha?~
@766  = ~Can I ask you a question?~
@767  = ~You're a cleric and an illusionist?  Does that mean you have spells?~
@768  = ~(Peony's reading the scorched note over your shoulder.) Throwing rocks into the Crystal Golems. Hmm, sounds like fun! I bet they fall into a myriad of glistening pieces. ~
@769  = ~Peony, would you MIND!~
@770  = ~Well, that's why we got slings. That reminds me of when I was a kid, only back then it was the sparrows, not Crystal Golems.~
@771  = ~Hee-hee, the bigger they are-~
@772  = ~It sounds like a good way to destroy them. We should be grateful to our nameless courier and that Oria for the warning and for the tips.~
@773  = ~And the fun we're going to have!~
@774  = ~...the more sparkles!~
@775  = ~You shot at sparrows? Eww. I mean, blackbirds, that's another matter entirely!~
@776  = ~Sheesh, you act like I was doing something improper. Well, read your stupid messages on your own then!~
@777  = ~I like this silver ring. It's simple, and something about it stirs my blood.~
@778  = ~The half-dragon was a formidable woman, but no match to a Matron Mother.~
@779  = ~Or you, Mistress.~
@780  = ~Yep, that's us, our three-legged pirate from Luskan right up front and all!~
@781  = ~What three-legged pirate?! ~
@782  = ~I think she meant me.~
@783  = ~Behind you!~
@784  = ~Peony, let's not get distracted. We came here to kill them, not to trade jokes!~
@785  = ~By Auril's icy breath, attack them!~
@786  = ~He's right unfortunately. I'm sorry that we've come too late.~
@787  = ~What happened here, Captain Yurst?~
@788  = ~Tell me what happened here.~
@789  = ~Hmm, those bodies look like rag dolls.~
@790  = ~Who's "killing" you?~
@791  = ~What's wrong?~
@792  = ~Why are those giants attacking you?~
@793  = ~Why are those fomorian giants attacking you?~
@794  = ~We took care of those giants that were attacking you.~
@795  = ~Why were those giants attacking you?~
@796  = ~I've no idea why those fomorian giants are attacking you, but we'll see what we can do.  Farewell.~
@797  = ~Traversing the foothills, we came upon a wounded soldier from the Luskan militia named Captain Yurst.  Giants were pelting him with boulders from afar, and we agreed to dispatch them.~
@798  = ~I've no idea why giants are attacking you, but we'll see what we can do.  Farewell.~
@799  = ~What do you want me to do?~
@800  = ~I can't help you.  Farewell.~
@801  = ~You're becoming callous, young lady. This 'adventure' might not have been the best idea for you.~
@802  = ~Please, don't send me home, grandma! Let me stay and play a little longer!~
@803  = ~Really, I can look after my own, Valeero, and decide what's best for me and what is not.~
@804  = ~Neither the human's life, nor the lives of the four giants are worth that much. Even adding all of them together, it's still cheaper to kill the lot.~
@805  = ~Here it is.~
@806  = ~It was costly, but we paid Goublika the five thousand gold he requested to stop his fomorian giants from attacking.  He seems to have honored our deal.~
@807  = ~All right, I'll return with the gold.  Farewell.~
@808  = ~We met a verbeeg giant in the foothills named Goublika and agreed to pay him five thousand gold to stop his fomorian giants from attacking.~
@809  = ~Will you take information instead?~
@810  = ~Either stop them or pay with your life!~
@811  = ~We browbeat a verbeeg giant in the foothills named Goublika into stopping his fomorian giants from attacking.~
@812  = ~Let me consider it.  Farewell.~

@814  = ~I am a delegate from the east.  I have come seeking an audience with their lordships, Isair and Madae.~

@816  = ~I am <CHARNAME>, from the east.  I have come seeking an audience with Isair and Madae!~
@817  = ~I am <CHARNAME>!  I have come to rid this land of the Legion of the Chimera and all who follow its foul banner!~

@819  = ~Which one of us lives, which one of us dies, <PROTAGONIST_SIRMAAM> Loud Mouth, remains to be seen.~
@820  = ~That creature do be sounding sincere.~
@821  = ~Why is it that you are hungry all the time?~
@822  = ~I know I am going to regret asking this, but just why are you so damn hungry all the time?~
@823  = ~This demon don't be looking any bigger than the ones we did kill in the Ice Temple. And we did kill a lot of them.~
@824  = ~Hildury is right. The demon can be dealt with.~
@825  = ~Stealing food from the slaves! This is low.~
@826  = ~Can you not ask for more food?~
@827  = ~We came here to destroy the leaders and free the slaves, which I gather is a surface tradition, of sorts. What does it matter how much food they'd get in their bellies today?~
@828  = ~Vashti has asked us to speak to the cook about getting more food allocated to the slaves.  We have agreed to do this.  The cook can be found in the kitchen on the fourth floor.~
@829  = ~I will take the matter under consideration.~
@830  = ~Vashti has asked us to speak to the cook about getting more food allocated to the slaves.  We are considering it.~
@831  = ~I cannot, I have other matters at hand.  Farewell.~
@832  = ~Vashti has asked us to speak to the cook about getting more food allocated to the slaves.  We refused.  We have other matters of importance to attend to.~
@833  = ~May I be allowed to take a look at the document, Miss? I have, uhm... altered manuscripts, on the odd occasion. ~
@834  = ~We met a slave girl named Ysha.  It seems that she delivered the wrong set of plans to one of the construction crews.  As a result, an area on the first floor of the fortress was reconstructed incorrectly.  We offered to help her by altering the plans to fit the construction that was done.  A deceit maybe, but one that could save her life and the lives of the work crew.~
@835  = ~Ah, yes, yes... ~
@836  = ~Hmm, is that better, miss?~
@837  = ~Oh, yes! I am forever in your debt.  I can never repay you for your kindness.~
@838  = ~Nikosh altered plans for Ysha.  She was grateful for our aid.~
@839  = ~Foul slavers! I had my doubts about the Legion, but now it is clear. I might have been too cowardly to attack the slave-masters of Mulhorand, but here and now I will not flee. I will fight! ~
@840  = ~That, *and* my idiot friend's comments, is no concern of yours.~
@841  = ~Do not presume to question *me*, slave, or listen in on my companion's idiotic outbursts.~
@842  = ~Well, here goes the part where we act in secret. I am an adventurer from Targos.  I am here to end the war with the Ten-Towns.~
@843  = ~I don't like having to face that damnable fiend one single bit with my ass on the line!~
@844  = ~Let's go, Sir Nord.~
@845  = ~I have no doubts that he feels the same way about it uhm... Wind.~
@846  = ~Bah-hah. I hope to treat him to another fine view in a short while: my falling sword.~
@847  = ~One honest man in this damned viper den, and he's addled.~
@848  = ~What do you intend to do?~
@849  = ~I can't help but think: "What if every weapon was replaced with a replica of this." Only if one wants to kill, one does not need a sword - a butter knife would do.~
@850  = ~He-he-he! What?! It's *funny*! Besides, they deserve it, making the elementals eat up all the dirt. You wouldn't like it, would you? ~
@851  = ~Then why have you not reported this to anyone?~
@852  = ~Saablic Tan did be a man of big appetites, for one so scrawny.~
@853  = ~Who is Saablic Tan?~
@854  = ~May I ask what you are doing here?~
@855  = ~Precious?  Who is that?~
@856  = ~Hmm, I wonder if he really was that scrawny, if her fondling those huge swords is any indication.~
@857  = ~Psst... Kill the man, use his lab... does any of you want the woman to seal the deal?~
@858  = ~(Cough) I am grateful.  Farewell.~
@859  = ~I would not have minded a bit of fun if not for the ruckus.~
@860  = ~You are impossible, Salomeya, and your thoughts are as black as your heart.~
@861  = ~This reminds me of another library, another man. I must tell you more of my old mentor, Librarian.~
@862  = ~What are you doing here?~
@863  = ~We met a man named Cedrin Zil.  He is the curator for a library on the second floor of the Severed Hand.~
@864  = ~Can you tell me what books you have here?~
@865  = ~I found this diary hidden among the books.  Can you tell me anything about it?~
@866  = ~Poor woman. Be she indeed the... gen... the elemental-spawn? She be looking like a human to me.~
@867  = ~What are you going on about, Vylu?~
@868  = ~I think we had best leave.  Farewell.~
@869  = ~Uhm, by her dress, I can tell she used to be a noblewoman. No wonder her head got messed up like that when she became a slave.~
@870  = ~We spoke with Vylu Prehv.  She seems to be suffering from some sort of mental disorder.  She is incoherent, to say the least.~
@871  = ~What are you going on about?~
@872  = ~We spoke with Vylu Prehv.  She seems to be suffering from some sort of mental disorder.  She is incoherent to say the least.~
@873  = ~Roga Thulc has sent me to speak with you, Vylu.~

@876  = ~Mages will be mages.~
@877  = ~You are not going anywhere until I know what just happened here.~
@878  = ~A disgusting minion of a disgusting deity.~
@879  = ~Who are you again?~
@880  = ~I am not familiar with Iyachtu Xvim.  Can you tell me about him?~
@881  = ~I think we found our missing mage from Kuldahar.~
@882  = ~Why not just ask him for access to the library?~
@883  = ~He implores us to steal, now. Think carefully before entering into this allegiance. This betrayal is not lessened by your ally's unsavory nature.~
@884  = ~Prachi, Prachi, you silly little idealist. What things, Vese?~
@885  = ~I'm sick of running errands for you.~
@886  = ~Granting you access to the Library was a fair thing to do. But I will not steal Orrick's possessions.~
@887  = ~To the Nine Hells with you, Vese!~
@888  = ~They are all vultures feeding on the carcass of my people's great citadel.~
@889  = ~Vultures?  What are you talking about?~
@890  = ~I understand you were the apprentice of Zaem Astyr.~
@891  = ~I agree, it was not well worded.~
@892  = ~Not well worded at all.~
@893  = ~You will taste all the sweeter for that.~
@894  = ~A polite son of a sow. A novelty.~
@895  = ~Heh, a fair son of a sow where the fiends go, I'd give him that.~
@896  = ~Six years?! For six years slavery flourishes here and everybody just sits on their asses?!~
@897  = ~The slaves are going hungry, Miram.~
@898  = ~Just... just like that? He had committed a treachery because he was passed for a promotion? This... this... this...!~
@899  = ~Breathe, Prachi, breathe!~
@900  = ~(takes a deep breath) I have no name for it.~
@901  = ~I find the crisis of faith in this creature... strange.~
@902  = ~Why are you becoming disillusioned, Drothan?~
@903  = ~We met a priest of Iyachtu Xvim named Drothan.  He claimed that he was becoming disillusioned with the church and is losing his faith.  Perhaps he would be willing to answer some questions.~
@904  = ~Brother, be listening to me. You be disappointed in more than being in the Severed Hand, you be disappointed in the cruel ideals. Serving a kinder deity be more rewarding.~
@905  = ~I see.  Where can I find Eradru?~
@906  = ~I found the diary of a priest named Garuk.  In it he mentions being promoted over you.~
@907  = ~I must take my leave of you, Drothan.  Farewell, and I would suggest taking Hildury's advice to heart.~
@908  = ~Yes, and don't forget to give him an address of the local Radiant Fart's Chapter. He's one step from adding Sir to his name.~
@909  = ~Officer's Tower? I thought they were named after elven gods - Labelas Tower and Corellon's.... Huh, at least that's what Oswald told me.~
@910  = ~Can you give me a delegate pass?~
@911  = ~We asked Xavier if we could see the envoy imprisoned in the tower.  He was unable to help us, but says that we can speak to the captain of the guard about the matter.  He is in the Officer's Tower, off of the fourth floor of the fortress.~
@912  = ~I have the pass that you gave me.  I am grateful, Xavier.~
@913  = ~He-he! She's talking about a *laboratory*! I thought it was a *lavatory* for a moment... Uhm, I see that you are not amused.~
@914  = ~Now, that's a new spin on the good old 'save princess from the dragon's tower' tale! *Half*-dragons are the best this place has to offer, unless I've wrongly guessed.~
@915  = ~Riki informed us that Isair and Madae have allied with a deity named Iyachtu Xvim.  She said that severing their ties with him would severely weaken them.  We are to seeking out a priest of Ilmater imprisoned in the War Tower and ask him about a purification ritual.~
@916  = ~I have allied with Iyachtu Xvim as well.~
@917  = ~I know the priest you speak of.  He is dead.~
@918  = ~I have spoken with him already.  He wants me to perform the ritual.~
@919  = ~I have spoken with him already.  He wanted to discuss the ritual with me, but I was not interested.~
@920  = ~Five portals like this.... a pentagram? No, it can't be that easy. The Red Wizards would have tried it.~
@921  = ~I'm deathly tired of every miser saying that he's going to kill me. That they include the rest of you in the bargain is even more rapidly growing old.~
@922  = ~No stinking drow calls me a miser!~
@923  = ~Ouch. I really don't want anythin' unpleasant happen to me, so I guess, we just have to kill this ball of purple slime.... Tymora, what am I sayin'?~
@924  = ~::Terror, sweet terror.::~
@925  = ~I did be wondering when we be seeing a drow here. They do be popping in all sorts of places.~
@926  = ~What is a fellow drow doing here?~
@927  = ~Maybe he is remembering his previous life.~
@928  = ~But wait...  I...  oh, forget it.~
@929  = ~I'd tell you to rest easy, but I guess it should be 'suffer easy'. We will do your bidding and purify the Severed Hand.~
@930  = ~Very well.  I shall return when my tasks are completed, Toral.~
@931  = ~We met a cleric of Ilmater jailed in the eastern cell of the War Tower.  His name is Toral Sorn, and he was sent here to try and convert Madae back to her faith in Ilmater.  It did not work.  However, he said he had a second mission, which was to sanctify the waters of Severed Hand at Ilmater's statue in the Cleric's Tower.  He asked if we could carry out the task for him, now that he was too weak to carry it out himself.  We agreed and learned that we must gather four items to make the sanctification ritual work:  The Tome of Ilmater, which might be in the Mage Tower library; Toral's Bonds of Suffering, which were lost during a torture session;  Madae's Ilmater medallion, which we hope Madae still has somewhere in one of Severed Hand's many chambers;  and Tears of the Suffering, which we probably can get from a slave.  He then asked us to return once we have completed the ritual.

An additional note, Toral mentioned that performing this ritual might have a direct affect on the Globe of Essence; a device that keeps the glabrezu guards immortal.  Successfully performing the Ilmater ritual could make the globe vulnerable to attack, which would then allow us to permanently destroy the glabrezu guards.  ~
@932  = ~I wish that my eyes could un-see this shameful sight. An elf that would pray to a human deity, when our kin must resist and avenge! We don't need him any more.~
@933  = ~The memory will burn in my mind, but I shall end this perversion.~
@934  = ~No, you don't under-~
@935  = ~The cowardly man who'd torment his foe instead of facing him in an honest combat will be slain, archimandrite.~
@936  = ~Where might I find this Tyrannar Brutai Mar?~
@937  = ~I'm glad to see you return to your natural form, sir.~
@938  = ~Then I owe you thanks, Ormis.  Until a later time.~
@939  = ~You're a pig, a cowardly, treacherous, foul... (deep breath in)~
@940  = ~PIG! Gods, but that felt good!~
@941  = ~Blasphemer!~
@942  = ~We gained access to the Tyrannar Brutai Mar's lair, where the Tyrannar himself, and three of his Ruinlords, attacked us.~
@943  = ~I fail to observe a significant improvement; it is but another demonic form.~
@944  = ~The idiot man from Bryn Shander didn't think what his stupid joke would cost the messenger! A stupid, damnable fool.~
@945  = ~Calm yourself!  I have no intention of harming you!  Who are you, and why have you been imprisoned here?~
@946  = ~Pull yourself together, you quivering mound of goblin dung! ~
@947  = ~A half-ass mercy! Still, it's more than anyone here did for the slaves.~
@948  = ~I see...~
@949  = ~Have you been questioned about the fate of the slaves?~
@950  = ~Thank you for what you've done, mage. You remind me of these brave souls in Mulhorand, who'd help the run-away slaves to find the portals and flee the cursed country.~
@951  = ~You employ them?~
@952  = ~Why not free all the slaves at the Hand?~
@953  = ~You're such a pack-rat, my friend.~
@954  = ~Of course! For me, it's kind of like a memento of all the slaughter I wrought during this campaign against the Legion of the Chimera.~
@955  = ~Doesn't everybody carry around a dead cat?  It's soft, and furry - well, parts of him are still furry - it's low maintenance, and the smell is rather cleansing, once you get used to it.~
@956  = ~Oh, him?  He's my good luck charm!  You see, he was my first kill, and ever since then I've been carrying him around for good luck.  As you can see with my exemplary success against the Legion of the Chimera's many hordes, he works like a charm!~
@957  = ~Her name is MISTY!  Be polite to my Misty, she's very dear to me.  It's hard enough to offer her to you, even though it was her suggestion.  What?  What's that, sweety?  You think the lumpy demon is funny looking...?~
@958  = ~Ha, ha, funny you should ask.  You see, I'm their chaperone for their date - you know, I'm around so they don't do anything that they would later regret.  It'd be a shame if I had to end their little outing by handing one of them over to you, but...  Hey, wait a bit!  Why don't you chaperone them?~
@959  = ~Hey, easy on the *dead* comment - Buddy's very sensitive about that.  As for Spot, well, Buddy always harped about wanting a pet, so one day I caved and gave him one.  He was a tough bugger to get, but one swift *whack...*~
@960  = ~Hey, easy on the *dead* comment - Misty's very sensitive about that.  As for Spot, well, Misty always harped about wanting a pet, so one day I caved and gave her one.  He was a tough bugger to get, but one swift *whack...*~

@963  = ~(The elf turns away, his eyes burning with dangerous fervor.)~
@964  = ~Uhm, by the look of it, the Legion does offer a man big, uhm... opportunities....~
@965  = ~Two escorts? That's too much honor for you, foul beast.~
@966  = ~Is that how surfacers keep things secret? By letting huge half-dragons land in plain sight on the top of the tower? Intriguing.~
@967  = ~We intercepted the half-dragon envoy.  Unfortunately, the escort guard arrived a few moments after we did, thus enclosing us between three powerful half-dragons and a battalion of Legion of Chimera guards.~
@968  = ~Oh! How did we end up surrounded? The evildoers do be sneaking upon us from behind far too much for my liking.~
@969  = ~Poor fellow will never know the happy feeling un' gets eatin' a good dinner. (Sigh). Well, more for the rest of us.~
@970  = ~I am glad to have been of aid, Zaem.  Farewell.~
@971  = ~Do not return until you have slain the innocents!~
@972  = ~The proposal is reasonable, however, in view of the desecration of Corellon's statue, and the befouling of the Severed Hand, I implore you to reconsider.~
@973  = ~No, that does not be right. NOOO! ~
@974  = ~You are breaking my heart, Northern Light. I cannot stay and watch you kill... kill... someone like me. Like I was once. ~
@975  = ~I cannot stay and watch you kill... kill... someone like me. Like I was once.~
@976  = ~Ouf, and for a moment I thought you were goin' to fight him. Thank Tymora we aren't.~
@977  = ~Well, kid, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I've failed you. I've done all I could... but it wasn't enough. I don't know how I'm going to look into your Lord father's eyes... Bah. ~
@978  = ~Oi, that's going to be unpleasant, killing all these innocent slaves. But what can we do?~
@979  = ~This alliance is not to my liking, but it's not my place to disobey the command given.~
@980  = ~What an outdated idea of innocence. Slaves... Ha! I can tell such stories. But I doubt we have time for it. Busy, busy, busy.~
@981  = ~A fair deal, and a far easier test than I imagined.~
@982  = ~If you counted on my blessing to do this, you erred. ~
@983  = ~YOUR DEATH!~
@984  = ~YES! (Diriel looks shocked by his own outburst, but then his eyes yet again stop on the desecrated statue of Corellon and he trains his weapon on the avatar.~
@985  = ~I did be waiting and praying for a battle like this. If it be my fate to fall, I be happy, if I scored but one hit at this evilness.~
@986  = ~I'll rain lightning down upon him!~

@990  = ~I do not deem myself ready to face an avatar yet, but I will do what I must and fight to the bitter end.~
@991  = ~Now, this should be a crown jewel in my saga. Please, everyone, make sure that I survive. You see, I can immortalize you in song postmortem, but the dead do not sing.~

@993  = ~Lathander, light our way!~
@994  = ~DEATH!~
@995  = ~Come along, brother.~
@996  = ~It would be logical for them to escape. However, in the interest of this conflict having a satisfactory conclusion, I express hope that they are currently not driven by logic, but by passion.~

@1020 = ~I'd like 1000 gold for it.~
@1021 = ~I offer it freely.~
@1022 = ~Actually, I must leave you now.  Farewell.~
@1023 = ~You are under orders to kill us, and you want us to help you? This must be another twist of  wondrous surfacer logic.~
@1024 = ~Can you undo the spell you cast yesterday?  Since it was flawed, it's breaking down and probably causing other problems.~
@1025 = ~That's not our concern.  Farewell.~
@1026 = ~There's an old saying that advises those who would treat with snakes to keep antidote close.~
@1027 = ~May I ask another question?~
@1028 = ~Must we fight him again? Slim pickings, for a king, if you ask me, and I doubt 'twould be better this time.~
@1029 = ~Death to those who stand on the way of the natural order of things!~
@1030 = ~The brain-dead man fell for *that*? I don't know which one of them is more pathetic.~
@1031 = ~Well, you start to look more desirable with every passing moment, my dear paladin's son.~
@1032 = ~'The Eternal Flame?' I'd have preferred  'The Trials and Tribulations of the Fiery Blobs'.~
@1033 = ~Why not?~
@1034 = ~Actually, you mentioned trials?~ ~One of the Flamewalker residents of Dragon's Eye's magma chamber told us a trial was held for Izbelah two days ago at the amphitheatre.  She was accused of violating Nature's Order, but Inquisitor Venomin proved her innocence.~
@1035 = ~Actually, you mentioned trials?~ ~One of the Flamewalker residents of Dragon's Eye's magma chamber told us a trial was held for Izbelah yesterday at the amphitheatre.  She was accused of violating Nature's Order, but Inquisitor Venomin offered her a good defense.~
@1036 = ~We'll pass.  Farewell.~
@1037 = ~I'd like very much to see the play, but how do you be telling one character from another? They all be looking the same to me.~
@1038 = ~My Lord, speaking of the tariff.... Could we perhaps arrange a set price per trip, as opposed to paying per person, every time?~
@1039 = ~I do not interfere with commerce, Stonewalker. Thou must needs negotiate with Archon.~
@1040 = ~May I ask a question?~
@1041 = ~I see.  Farewell.~
@1042 = ~My Lord, your realm's er... fiery welcome is undisputable (at least... uhm... today) with a single exception.~
@1043 = ~Speak freely, Stonewalker. Who hindered your progress through our land?~
@1044 = ~Mephits, my Lord. They... uhm... spit magma.~
@1045 = ~Mephits? Oh-ha-ha, thou must forgive them. The playful beasts know not a Stonewalker from our residents, and pull their pranks equally on one and all. Thou must understand, a splash of magma is naught for people of fire.~
@1046 = ~A play?~
@1047 = ~Before we said farewell to Lord Pyros, he told us to see one of the flamewalker plays in the amphitheater.  All we needed to do was speak to one of the flamewalkers, and they would perform for us. ~
@1048 = ~Perhaps we will.  Farewell.~
@1049 = ~Wow, they're just like walking bonfires! I want to jump over one.~
@1050 = ~What's the amphitheatre used for?~
@1051 = ~Oh my, it's even better the second time around!~
@1052 = ~We met a yuan-ti inquisitor on the last level of Dragon's Eye named Venomin.  He claimed to have caused a war between the yuan-ti and the "Lords of Fire", wishing he could "return to yesterday" to undo the damage he'd caused.  Before we could question him further he leapt to his death into the sea of magma.~
@1053 = ~Wait!  Don't do it!~
@1054 = ~We met Inquisitor Venomin again in the same location as yesterday and he said the exact same thing to us, but we were still unable to get any more information from him before he wished for "yesterday" then committed suicide.~
@1055 = ~Your Majesty, don't envy a priest his power. It comes at the cost of greater humility than any other man knows, because we behold the magnificence of the gods.~
@1056 = ~Lord Pyros mentioned you having a yuan-ti prisoner who tried casting a spell.~
@1057 = ~Look, he be taller than I!~
@1058 = ~Why are you so angry?~
@1059 = ~Nothing.  Farewell.~
@1060 = ~I perceive that something unnatural is afoot. Do not request proof. I have none. It is, much as I despise to say this, a premonition.~
@1061 = ~Kingslayer! This crime is punishable by death.~
@1062 = ~I must say that, despite the grim outlook, I enjoy the weirdness of discussing things with a salamander that is an ambassador between the yuan-ti and the strange fire-folk.~
@1063 = ~Where's High Sorceress Izbelah?~
@1064 = ~Amidst a ruined palace on Dragon's Eye's last level - its magma chamber - we met a fire salamander named Ambassador Jasper who was a liaison between the residents here and the yuan-ti.  He told us High Priest Thorasskus sent yuan-ti pureblood inquisitor Venomin here three days ago to conduct an investigation into the disappearance of High Sorceress Izbelah.  For reasons he was unaware of, Venomin killed Lord Pyros yesterday and fled to Jasper's embassy east of the palace.  As a result, King Lothar assumed control, declared war on the yuan-ti, destroyed the embassy, and sent efreet assassins after Thorasskus.  When the yuan-ti responded, chaos erupted.  Izbelah was instantly killed two days ago while, from what he understood, escaping from Lothar's cage.~
@1065 = ~Stop, you fool of a man!~
@1066 = ~Three hundred per person?! That's un' expensive boat-ride. But I suppose this isn't your ordinary fishpond.~
@1067 = ~The price is set. Will you pay?~
@1068 = ~Yes.~
@1069 = ~Will you take items instead?~
@1070 = ~We paid double last time in anticipation of this trip.  Don't you remember?~
@1071 = ~Actually we'd like to go someplace else.~
@1072 = ~No.  Farewell.~
@1073 = ~Have no fear, boy, we're coming to help you. Though it beats me how and why you got cornered by all these cursed efreeti.~
@1074 = ~We'll take care of those monsters.  Farewell.~
@1075 = ~On the third level of Dragon's Eye, within a secluded room protected by a mechanical bridge, we ran into a boy being attacked by efreet.~
@1076 = ~What's going on?~
@1077 = ~Aren't you rather young to be radiating evil so strongly?  Who or what are you?~
@1078 = ~You're Thorasskus - as in "his greatness" High Priest Thorasskus?~
@1079 = ~No surprises here.~
@1080 = ~Master?~
@1081 = ~Boo-hoo! 'Wipe my nose and save me from the big bad efreeti.' Some adventure!~
@1082 = ~Let me see, let me see! I know you've found something interesting!~
@1083 = ~Wish grandma could see this. She used to go on and on about being dedicated and never quitting. Well, it's *stupid* that this cute guy had to die so that Nheero could grow a few scales!~
@1084 = ~Burn tall, burn hot, and burn clear!
  --Warm my nose, toes and ear!~
@1085 = ~If that do be an account of noble deeds written on the tiny stone, it be good if someone read it out loud.~
@1086 = ~By the Nine Hells! That's just the thing to make this old fool  lose the last of his hair. Duke's Ehld's own sword within reach, and no doubt the Lost Followers too.~
@1087 = ~A pommel jewel from Cera Sumat! What other wonders lay hidden in this unholy place?~
@1088 = ~He wants to go to the library... as if we were in Waterdeep or Silverymoon, or some such reasonable place!~
@1089 = ~Yes, there's one connected to a workroom on the level below.~
@1090 = ~Yes, there's one connected to a workroom in the southern portion of this level.~
@1091 = ~Can I ask about something else then?~
@1092 = ~No, but I'll let you know if we do.  Farewell.~
@1093 = ~And all that from one cup? Tee-hee, strong stuff, this mandrake root!~
@1094 = ~Can I ask about something else?~
@1095 = ~Cursed be the evil that separates body and will!~
@1096 = ~This weapon might not be decorated by gold and jewels, but it belonged to a man who died protecting his master. I'm glad that we'll return it to the honorable spirit.~
@1097 = ~A volcano full of snakes - there is something disturbing, unbalancing about this combination. I'll need to meditate soon, my companions.~
@1098 = ~I remember a similar charm on the doors of Matron Ginafae's daughter. She enjoyed summoning men of the household and seeing them repelled by the ward, growing ever more fearful that they were late, and that the Misstres should think they had disobeyed. I think some pitched their will so strongly against the compulsion that they died. That amused her the most.~
@1099 = ~So, a snake pit. (shrug) Feels like home.~
@1100 = ~Unchained now. Go, kinsman, and be free.~
@1101 = ~Backtrackin' for an hour and for what? A weed!~
@1102 = ~The poor man died horribly. Your curiosity has high price, mage.~
@1103 = ~Whether we switch the mandrake root or intimidate D'hey-jazzerion, we'll need to know where he is... either to avoid him, or to "convince" him. ~
@1104 = ~D'hey Jazerrion?! (shakes her head) What's in the name...~
@1105 = ~In his case, it's the alphabet.~
@1106 = ~I'd like us to lay my kinsman to rest.~
@1107 = ~We'll find his sword and return it to him.  Farewell.~
@1108 = ~We found his sword on the third level.  We shall promptly return it to him.~
@1109 = ~The bloody mage is mad as a loon.~
@1110 = ~That doesn't sound like a fitting end for a sage.  Surely you had a plan?~
@1111 = ~Mandal Graye, Nheero's traveling companion, was supposed to find where the yuan-ti make their histachii brew and replace the mandrake root used in the process with a version Nheero had modified.  The resulting brew would be less potent, thus allowing him to keep his wits about him as he temporarily experienced the full sensation of the transformation.~
@1112 = ~What can you tell us about these yuan-ti?~
@1113 = ~Nheero told us that the yuan-ti are evil but intelligent snake people who worship Sseth, the Great Snake and Intermediate Power of the Abyss.  They adhere to a hierarchical order and are comprised of almost-human purebloods, female halfbreeds, ruling abominations, and a high priest.  They fight brilliantly, relying on their surroundings and elaborate traps often coated with poison.  When not stalking prey, their priests divide their time between prayer, bloody sacrifices, summonings, and other rituals.~
@1114 = ~Poor things! If they rely on *intelligent* males to copulate, most of them are still virgins.~
@1115 = ~You seem intelligent.  Did they misplace you?~
@1116 = ~A snake can get out of its skin, but it cannot hide its scales. You might look human, but your heart is with Sseth.~
@1117 = ~Yxunomei?~
@1118 = ~Stand aside.~
@1119 = ~So be it.  Prepare yourself.~
@1120 = ~Let's end this!~
@1121 = ~Sseth will see to your demise.~
@1122 = ~You be meaning that lives be in peril despite our coming? Strange. We be saving many.~
@1123 = ~Someun' must have been workin' day and night to lay all these traps. I feel almost uhm... honored.~
@1124 = ~I'd have been more impressed with them dressing the road with velvets and cloth of gold for our arrival.~
@1125 = ~Paving the bloody thing would have been better. I'm sick of trotting through half-frozen mud.~
@1126 = ~Hey, what a surprise! Haven't seen you in a loooong time!~
@1127 = ~It had to be done, Saablic.~
@1128 = ~Like a bad penny!~
@1129 = ~I will execute you for defiling my dead kin, human.~
@1130 = ~The surfacer paid the blood price for daring to humiliate the drow. You shall, too.~
@1131 = ~So Imphraili was *your* apprentice!  That means you are just as much to blame for those abominations in the Underdark as she.~
@1132 = ~Murder?  I prefer *eradication.*~
@1133 = ~Saralon was a fine man. 'Til the end, he strived to eradicate these abominations, the mockery of our glorious kin. ~
@1134 = ~Think nothing of it.  Good journey to you, Tsol.~
@1135 = ~Did you... did you just expressed a desire to consume us? To... devour us? I... I suspect that a magical delirium was inflicted upon me in our past battle. The bile... rising... my throat.... ~
@1136 = ~The way he's doubling over, it seems I have one less of you to deal with. Good.~
@1137 = ~An elven lich? I have all reasons to believe that this creature is unable to process the factual data. ~
@1138 = ~Why does he attack your camp?~
@1139 = ~May I ask you something else?~
@1140 = ~Then I will kill you and the lich!~
@1141 = ~Bwa-ha-ha! You die!~
@1142 = ~We will most certainly *not*!~
@1143 = ~Then you die.~
@1144 = ~We lied to the dread orc shaman, Kratuuk, and said that we were the war party sent by Saablic Tan.  He told us that an elven lich, named M'darfein, attacked his camp on a regular basis, and that we must venture forth and slay the lich.  He also gave us a key that will open a secret door in the northeast section of the gate that leads out to the ancient battlefield. And that's when Valeero spoiled the whole ruse by loudly refusing to worship Saablic Tan.~
@1145 = ~He carved himself a tiny Empire. It matters not that his slice of the realms is a slightly emptier piece in the greater wasteland, or that his worshipers are some orcs. How so very Thayvian!~
@1146 = ~Maybe I will raise you. It would be a great pleasure to command you to shut up.~
@1147 = ~(Sigh) Yeah... Uhm, to battle!~
@1148 = ~Once again we faced Saablic Tan.  He seemed none too pleased that we successfully cleared out the Fields of Slaughter, and now he has vowed to halt our progress.  We cannot allow that to happen.~
@1149 = ~There is no magic in the world capable of shutting this one, trust me.~
@1150 = ~She's a banshee in training, you idiot.~
@1151 = ~We can't have that!~
@1152 = ~You don't have the power to harm her or any of my friends.~
@1153 = ~Nobody speaks to my love that way. Die!~
@1154 = ~One should not cry like an old woman for that which he could not defend like a warrior.~
@1155 = ~Let us fall back for a moment, Northern Light, and look at the water rushing down the icy cliff. The lace of icicles, the song of the water between the banks, every shade of blue and white, the frozen shivering rainbows: do you see? It's all so pure now... like your love.~
@1156 = ~Let me kiss away the glittering water-dust from your cheeks and your hair....~
@1157 = ~The only hypothesis that explains these facts is that this so-called elven female was corrupted in surrendering all which made her elven.~
@1158 = ~Tell me what happened to Egenia after Ilmadia's children were born.~
@1159 = ~Let's talk about something else.~
@1160 = ~This ghost is a lesson to all primitive creatures given to emotional travesties: never assist in the survival of the half-breeds, particularly when they are a product of higher races.~
@1161 = ~What can you tell about Isair?~
@1162 = ~Tell me about Madae.~
@1163 = ~I will leave you to your thoughts, spirit.  Farewell.~
@1164 = ~I will voice no objections to leaving this disgusting specimen to its fate.~
@1165 = ~Who are you - and who did this to you?~
@1166 = ~We found a wounded dwarf named Gerbash - he had been wounded with yuan-ti arrows and had slipped into one of the houses in Kuldahar to hide from them.~
@1167 = ~Are you Gerbash?~
@1168 = ~I'd watch your words, especially considering we've come from the Ten-Towns to stop your town from being turned into cordwood.  Who attacked you?~
@1169 = ~Well, one of us is in better shape than the other - and I suggest you not forget that, dwarf.  Are you Gerbash?~
@1170 = ~I find this as amusing as salt in wounds.~
@1171 = ~We need to get to the Severed Hand.  How can we help you so you can help us?~
@1172 = ~What is that glowing green gem in the center of the standing stones?~
@1173 = ~What do you know about Isair and Madae?~
@1174 = ~Tell me what happened after Ilmadia was revived.~
@1175 = ~Tell me more about the yuan-ti half-breeds in Dragon's Eye.~
@1176 = ~Tell me what happened to Isair and Madae after you arrived.~
@1177 = ~Tell me about what happened to Isair and Madae after they left Kuldahar.~

@1179 = ~Do you know why the Legion of the Chimera has been attacking Icewind Dale?~
@1180 = ~How can we get to the Severed Hand from here?~
@1181 = ~Can you heal us? ~
@1182 = ~Shamefully, I envy the twins the time when Mother Egenia sheltered them. I wonder if I was ever shielded by a loving hand in my infancy?~
@1183 = ~Poor, poor Jaemal. He was never loved as a baby! By Beshaba, I think you're making someone's eyes wet.~
@1184 = ~I am sorry if I made you weep, oh gentle soul.~
@1185 = ~I cry when I have to mince onions or perform a love song... by the same reason, really:  both stink. I was talking about the purveyor of loving hands.~
@1186 = ~How is that that the slow old eunuch did not guess what a sharp young bard meant?~
@1187 = ~The abdominal cleric raised those who once came to defend Kuldahar... to destroy it.~
@1188 = ~Such subtle irony... I'm surprised that someone else noticed it.~
@1189 = ~I'm sure it was not lost on the townsfolk. Though I doubt they smile prettily over it.~
@1190 = ~I'm a veritable waterfall of tears!~
@1191 = ~My heart bleeds for you.~
@1192 = ~Oh, run along and administer your impotent consolations to one who needs them!~
@1193 = ~Northern Light, this garment gives your movements wonderful fluidity. You look so mysterious and dangerous, that I could have been scared... if I did not find it so alluring.~
@1194 = ~It's bloody good to see that the old man can't even remember which one of the towns came to the rescue. The Ten-Towners were always the ones to stand together in the time of need and think nothing of it.~
@1195 = ~We're looking for someone named Gerbash - have you seen him?~
@1196 = ~We found your son, but he had... an accident of sorts.  Searching abandoned mage towers is a task best left to bloodthirsty mercenaries.~
@1197 = ~We told Conlan we'd found Sheemish in Orrick's Tower, but we neglected to mention the fact we killed him.~
@1198 = ~We've encountered your son - he's fine, but there proved to be more in Orrick's stash than he thought.  He's still searching the place.~

@1205 = ~Perhaps I'll return later.  Farewell.~
@1206 = ~A fine welcoming committee. Didn't even step off the ship, as we run into Bane's minions. How do you like that?!~

@1208 = ~What happened then?~
@1209 = ~What happened again?~
@1210 = ~Jermsy, I... I be glad that I be too young to have been one of the raiders. But I be begging your forgiveness-~

@1220 = ~The Archdruid of Kuldahar, Iselore, asked us to help stop an impending threat to the village and its great oak.  He believes that yuan-ti from Dragon's Eye have opened a magical "crossroad" to a jungle in Chult, far to the south.  He asked that we find a way to seal the portal from the other side.  This involves slaying the "guardian" of the crossroads.  Iselore believes that the yuan-ti are probably protecting the guardian to insure that this does not happen.~
@1221 = ~Talking, talking... it be known that he be a priest of Bane, an evil man. We must be choosing swords over words!~

@1251 = ~I know that yuan-ti are abominations and all, but they are so pretty and graceful! Wow.~
@1252 = ~Awsome?! NO! This green gem of yours is *phantasmagoric*! One day I'll figure out how to make one just like that, only in bright orange. I don't want to be a copy-cat, you know.~

@1254 = ~There is just one thing I don't understand - how can pastries be filled with holy water? They'd go all soggy.~

@1275 = ~Jermsy wanted us to find you - he was worried you'd died, and he was worried the watchtower key you had had fallen into the yuan-ti's hands.~
@1276 = ~Jermsy had... an *accident.*  But he wanted me to get that key from you.~
@1277 = ~You can't talk a wolf out of howling....~
@1278 = ~Climb on board!~
@1279 = ~There is no need to mourn time as wasted. Our expedition through the Underdark was by far more educational than the alternative.~
@1280 = ~We be going to Kuldahar by this ship now? I be not regretting the good deeds we've done while we did be taking the long way around.~
@1281 = ~I suppose we should have put more faith in the Mending spell.~
@1282 = ~Kuldahar is under attack? Oh, blazing hells, let's not dally any further with bantering.~
@1283 = ~We could have taken the flyin' ship all along riskin' no more than freezin' our behinds to the Ice Temple floors while waitin'. Ty-mo-ra!~
@1284 = ~Uncle Oswald, uncle Oswald! I have such stories to tell you! You won't believe what we saw!~
@1285 = ~We learned the way of the birds in the sky, the way of the beasts in the forest and the way of the snakes under rocks. Now we only need experience the way of the fish in the sea.~
@1286 = ~I hate flying. The heavens are too empty and nothing wards off the sun.~
@1287 = ~As they say, better later than never.~
@1288 = ~Hurry on, hurry on!~
@1289 = ~Oh, here we go! So, that's why it's called the Black Raven Monastery, when the only birdies around are white wyrms! I've been trying to wrap my head around it since we came here!~
@1290 = ~Tell me about the Valas, the Black Raven.~
@1291 = ~What are the monastery's key beliefs?~
@1292 = ~How does one join the monastery?~
@1293 = ~What tomes and scrolls do you have available?~
@1294 = ~A jar of pickled eggs is no threat to us! What?! He... She... It does look awfully much like pickled eggs!~
@1295 = ~What are you?~
@1296 = ~We do not seek any trouble.~
@1297 = ~You enslave the weak-willed and kill innocents.  For that, you will die, monster.~
@1298 = ~We met a strange brain creature in a vat at the center of the Z'hinda Citadel.  Though its telepathic speech was calm, it had no qualms about attacking us with powerful psionic abilities.~
@1299 = ~You are an abomination of nature.  It is my duty to see that your existence does not continue.~
@1300 = ~Die, you horrible creature!~
@1301 = ~ -- It is very difficult for humans to understand our way of life.  Attack if you feel compelled, but you will fail. --~
@1302 = ~ -- You are as much of an abomination to us as we are to you.  If your strange morality insists that you attack, press on.  You will fail. --~
@1303 = ~ -- It can only be a profound lack of wisdom that drives you to such hostility.  You should have remained in your own land.  Now you will suffer. --~
@1304 = ~And we shall blast them right back! Only we'd be dead and all. Damnity-damn.~
@1305 = ~Who is Iselore?~
@1306 = ~Why is Maralie here?  She's very small.~
@1307 = ~How did you know we were here?~
@1308 = ~What's happening in the Ten-Towns?~
@1309 = ~Before we leave, we'd like to take a look at your potions.~
@1310 = ~We are ready to go to Kuldahar, Oswald.~
@1311 = ~Give us a moment to recover, Oswald.~
@1312 = ~Interesting experiments, but thoroughly immoral. They should have used humans or dwarves as subjects instead of elves.~
@1313 = ~This specimen is obnoxious in its arrogant self-assurance that everyone should hop when he says jump.~
@1314 = ~One does not need to be powerful to afford love, Master of Sorcere. (Is that... what she wants?)~
@1315 = ~Let me see what magical items you have for sale.~
@1316 = ~What can you tell me about this area?~
@1317 = ~Farewell, Malavon.~
@1318 = ~Rizdaer... ~
@1319 = ~(whispers in your ear) My Mystery, I made a fool out of myself, and I don't care. But I won't let you do the same in front of them. It's too dangerous.~
@1320 = ~(cough) Let... Let me see what magical items you have for sale, Malavon.~
@1321 = ~What can you tell me about this area, Master of Sorcere?~
@1322 = ~(scowl)~
@1323 = ~Why are you talking to this miserable mage? She's working for Chimera. She turns drow into driders. Kill the witch.~
@1324 = ~We met a woman named Imphraili Asserbai in a laboratory near the center of the drider caves.  She told us that she is a researcher for the school of transmutation.~
@1325 = ~You have a great number of tattoos.  Are you from Thay?~
@1326 = ~What do you know about a device that transforms drow into driders?~
@1327 = ~We learned of an object called the Viciscamera that changes drow into driders.~
@1328 = ~What *are* those things in the cages?~
@1329 = ~For once I agree with the drow.~
@1330 = ~Now, that's a beautiful sight. Too bad it took poison to kill it. I wished to run it through with my sword.~
@1331 = ~A male speaking for his House? This is unexpected.~
@1332 = ~In the Underdark below Black Raven Monastery, we met a dark elf who introduced himself as Malavon Despana.  He told us that he is the Archmage of Sorcere, an academy of magic, and the patron of a dark elven house in the city of Rilauven.~
@1333 = ~As charming and accommodating as any Matron Mother.~
@1334 = ~You came with the surfacers. Do you belong to my flock?~
@1335 = ~I abandoned gods; they abandoned me. I like this status quo. But my fearless leader seems to have more interest than I in the divine.~
@1336 = ~What you said, Kadresh, is excellent.  Perhaps you dhaeraow are finally coming to your senses.~
@1337 = ~And just *what* is so foolish about it, my heathen brother Kadresh?~
@1338 = ~Spiders. There are always spiders.~
@1339 = ~Egalitarian, hah! Traded a Spider Queen for a thief.~
@1340 = ~Continue.~
@1341 = ~The bloody thing is dead? Good, I bear no love for drow scum, but being turned into monstrous spiders is too much even for them.~
@1342 = ~The follies of love are not always things of madness.~
@1343 = ~He needs us; that's more reassuring than his word.~
@1344 = ~Very well, we will enter your camp.~
@1345 = ~If you will not give us your word, we will not enter.~
@1346 = ~That reminds me of Mulhorandi desert.~
@1347 = ~They be talking in my head! Out, out!~
@1348 = ~I did say they did be evil!~
@1349 = ~Of course.~
@1350 = ~She be completely changed... and so beautiful. (sigh)~
@1351 = ~In all cultures it seems the mountains are holy. One need not wonder why: a soul finds purity and enlightenment when eyes watch the crisp simplicity of this landscape. ~
@1352 = ~This is a mockery of custom. He knows in advance that we do not intend to stay and serve the Black Raven monastery and the Order.~
@1353 = ~The man has things to teach, and she's willing to learn. I see no wisdom in rejecting an eager student.~
@1354 = ~I'd offer to help, but am not good enough a teacher.~
@1355 = ~I'd offer to help, but am not yet skilled enough myself.~
@1356 = ~I know something of this - here, perhaps I can help...~
@1357 = ~We were able to help Sersa improve her skills by giving her some techniques to practice.  In return, she'll allow us to rest at the monastery at no cost.~
@1358 = ~Perhaps I can speak to Svaltid for you.~
@1359 = ~I see.  I'd like to rest.~
@1360 = ~Indeed it would have been for the best. If I took your post, I'd carry on the duties gladly, without yawning with every heartbeat. No hour need be idle for the one who is familiar with meditation.~
@1361 = ~My thanks, Morohem.  Farewell.~
@1362 = ~You heard what the lady said? Don't fall asleep on duty.~
@1363 = ~This den of spiders will require more focus and skill than the Chamber of Silk.~
@1364 = ~I used to steal eggs in my boyhood... didn't think back then 'twas such a perilous occupation!~
@1365 = ~This one is er... is in her right mind? Whiling her days in the shade of a statue - mmgh, a very fine bronze, by the way - and spider nets with spiders for company?~
@1366 = ~Yes, we are, and yes, we have.~
@1367 = ~We met Ginafae Despana, a drider, in the northern section of the drider caves.  She seemed resigned to the destruction of the Viciscamera and the drider uprising.~
@1368 = ~Yes, we are adventurers.  As for the Viciscamera, we have already destroyed it.~
@1369 = ~Yes, we are adventurers.  However, I know nothing about this "Viciscamera" you speak of.~
@1370 = ~Adventurers?  No, we're... explorers.~
@1371 = ~There's something comforting about this shield. Roundness and... hmm, I wonder if the goop on the tips of the spikes is poison.~
@1372 = ~(sniffs air) It brings back memories of the times when I studied with an alchemist. Poor delusional man thought he knew all the poisons... until I proved otherwise.~
@1373 = ~Well, if you like it desolate and creepy it's a prime piece of real estate.~
@1374 = ~And I thought spiders were bad. Brrr... I'm bound to have nightmares for *weeks*. Ah, I have such a tender psyche.~
@1375 = ~Oh, dear, but you let yourself go!~
@1376 = ~A generous reward! Why, it saved us at least five gold pieces!~
@1377 = ~I'd like to rest.~
@1378 = ~Farewell, Sersa.~
@1379 = ~Oh, it sounds toasty...~
@1380 = ~Oh, bugger it all! So bloody close to beheading Chimera. One well-aimed strike and...  Bah. Now we have to chase after them again.~
@1381 = ~Sir, this is childish. You know yourself that the 'seat by the fireplace is never vacant'. The army is there; they will find new leaders. ~
@1382 = ~Nah, an army without commanders, or where the superiors squabble for the top job is naught but a rabble.~
@1383 = ~Yakes! I think... I think I'm going be sick.~
@1384 = ~War-bears?!~
@1385 = ~I knew I could count on you to say that.~
@1386 = ~Phantasmagoric! Are we there yet? In the Underdark?~
@1387 = ~Yes, gnome, we are. Keep quiet now, or I'll silence you.~
@1388 = ~With a kiss?~
@1389 = ~With the flat of my blade.~
@1390 = ~Sheesh, you're no gentleman.~
@1391 = ~Miss, a true gentleman would never kiss a lady to er... stop her from talkin'.~
@1392 = ~Really? Then who needs them!~
@1393 = ~Whee! A key! Let's go find the matching lock now! It's sort of backwards, but still interesting.~
@1394 = ~Harsh justice is better than no justice.~
@1395 = ~No, please! I... It is not my place to dispute orders, but I will deeply regret attacking this peaceful monastery.~
@1396 = ~Fall back in line, Prachi. We'll do it.~
@1397 = ~We accepted Barud's offer to kill all the monks in the Black Raven Monastery.  We're to return to him for our reward when done.~
@1398 = ~No, but I had other questions.~
@1399 = ~Perhaps another time.  Farewell.~
@1400 = ~No - I will not consciously aid the cause of black-hearted duergar.  Farewell.~
@1401 = ~I am shamed to be even mistaken for someone who had abandoned their comrade to this gruesome fate.~
@1402 = ~I'm not who you think... just leave me be.~
@1403 = ~Wait - yes, I'm... sorry.  Please allow me to beg forgiveness.~
@1404 = ~I'll take my leave, now.  Farewell.~
@1405 = ~I confess that I wish to see these lights, to try my will against theirs and because... well, because they are probably beautiful.~
@1406 = ~Do you know if a man named Kyosti died in these woods?~
@1407 = ~We asked the spirit we met in the Fell Wood about the missing Kyosti.  He told us that if we would extinguish the ghost-lights and thereby put the Restless Dead of Fell Wood at ease, he would tell us what he knows.~
@1408 = ~My thanks.  Farewell, spirit.~
@1409 = ~Hook-beasts, Shambler... and we but walked two steps underground. (sigh) No wonder, I'm startin' to have heart palpitations every time we round a corner.~
@1410 = ~After we've slain two dragons it'll be a piece of cake. Er... it will, won't it?~
@1411 = ~What's the reward?~
@1412 = ~We'll do it.~
@1413 = ~We accepted Barud's offer to clear the river caves of all monsters.  We're to return to him for our reward when done.~
@1414 = ~Every respectable dragon has a hoard of treasure. Fancy we ran into one guardin' a hole in the ground instead. A very important hole by the look of it, but only a bunch of nothingness.~
@1415 = ~A remarkable craftsmanship. Why, Master Dwarf, you must try silversmithin' un' day!~
@1416 = ~Silversmithing, you lout? And how will *that* make me stronger and more powerful?!~
@1417 = ~Er... Gold-smithin', I meant gold-smithin' of course. Your work is as beautiful as any jeweler-~
@1418 = ~Almost as beautiful?! Someone get this idiot out of my sight!~
@1419 = ~That's an impressive machine.~
@1420 = ~It doesn't seem so complicated.~
@1421 = ~What can you tell me about this place?~
@1422 = ~Phew, what good is a weapon if you need Elminster to load it?~
@1423 = ~I always liked to test men who boast about their virility. Some of them are not even far off the mark. Pity you're going to end up very dead very shortly.~
@1424 = ~Oh, please. The first dragon was exhilarating, but a second one! It's getting repetitive, not to mention draining.... Why would two sit so close together?~
@1425 = ~And who was crying rivers that we didn't get to slay dragons like good littl' heroes?~
@1426 = ~Maybe they were a couple.~
@1427 = ~Ask the corpses.~
@1428 = ~Dragons, shmagons... all in a day's work.~
@1429 = ~It figures! Only a fool would prefer starting a fight to a nice chat over a cup of tea. Ah, I wish could have a cup of tea right now. Well laced with brandy.~
@1430 = ~A dragon and a shmagon would be better than two dragons in a row, moreover in the same color.~
@1431 = ~Feh.~
@1432 = ~Oh, sure, seeing how two mute dragons make a better trap than two talkative ones.~
@1433 = ~Phew. But you know what's strange? Dragons are famed for being wordy, and those two did not say a single thing!~
@1434 = ~That's because they are white dragons; they are not particularly intelligent. ~
@1435 = ~It saw you and gave up: too intelligent to hope to put a word in edgewise. ~
@1436 = ~Hmm, now that you mention it, it is indeed strange. A trap?~
@1437 = ~...and lived happily ever after, and died on the same day.~
@1438 = ~You see, my dear, I'm not one of those bards who writes 'How <CHARNAME> Heroically Slew a Dragon', 'How <CHARNAME> Heroically Slew a Dragon 2', and 'How <CHARNAME> Heroically Slew a Dragon 3.'~
@1439 = ~Tra-la-la, my muse sings to me, tra-la-la... we need new opponents to keep the Cycle of Brave <CHARNAME> rolling.~
@1440 = ~We must *earn* our passage by doing a slew of local-scale noble deeds? Typical. Saving the world is lost on the backwater crowd.~
@1441 = ~Thank you for the insight, Salomeya, but you might have mentioned that we already did Suoma's bidding.  Carita murdered Kyosti; her lover hid the corpse.  Both have fled.~
@1442 = ~We spoke with Kurttu and uncovered the mystery of Kyosti's silent ghost.  This was the third and final task Suoma had given us; having aided the village to the best of our ability, she is now willing to tell us how to pass through the Fell Wood.~
@1443 = ~Farewell, Suoma.~
@1444 = ~Why, but you are birds of a feather: both can be won by a stranger with a kind word. And they say *I* am easy! What slander!~
@1445 = ~Salomeya, you are anything but easy.~
@1446 = ~Jealous? How does it feel to have the tables turned, Salomeya?~
@1447 = ~How sweet of you to say so, dear. I'm positively melting.~
@1448 = ~Can we bicker some other time? I had some questions for Pairi.~
@1449 = ~You are? Can't you save it 'til we're not in the middle of a bloody village?!~
@1450 = ~I am kissing you right here and right now! You can kill me later.~
@1451 = ~You think you've turn the... Oh, my! You're trying to play a game of seduction! Sorry I didn't notice, my dear. I'd have played along otherwise.~
@1452 = ~Aww.... I'm all anticipation. You always lose.~
@1453 = ~Not that kind of melting, little paladin. I'm not you. But do go ahead, seeing as how trading words is so... satisfactory for you.~
@1454 = ~Mmgh... Ah, I would have this kiss last forever, but you wanted to ask something of this... girl? Well, go ahead, my dear.~
@1455 = ~Someone cut a corpse's tongue out to silence a ghost? Creative but stupid. What's hilarious is that the ethereal idiot believes that he can't talk.~
@1456 = ~Salomeya is right. If you spoke in life, perhaps you can speak now, in death. Please, try.~
@1457 = ~How insufferably rustic! Gods above, it makes me miss Targos.~
@1458 = ~You hated Targos.~
@1459 = ~Precisely.~
@1460 = ~So they did not have enough courage to face judgment. May the betrayers of trust be dirt underfoot for a thousand lives!~
@1461 = ~Shh, Prachi, no need to curse when the victim had forgiven her. Kyosti said he's resting in peace now, Kurttu.~
@1462 = ~If I were Kyosti, I wouldn't rest until Carita was dead.  Farewell.~
@1463 = ~Farewell, Kurttu.~
@1464 = ~I imagined the legendary warriors' spirits as less spiteful and well... absentminded.~
@1465 = ~So did I. (sigh) Chieftan, I stole nothing from you.  What is it you're missing?~
@1466 = ~It seems that the barrow wight is out and about on account of a common thief - someone has made off with its favorite drinking horn, and it's doubtful that the spirit will rest without it.  If we found the horn, the angry spirit should stop haunting the area.~
@1467 = ~No one accuses me of thievery, senility or not! Revoke those words.~
@1468 = ~With the mortal battles that we face, I look forward to the hours of peace that we'll find in the abode of serenity that guards the entrance to the underworld.~
@1469 = ~Hmm. Let's discuss business, now.~
@1470 = ~My thanks, Nym.  I had some questions.~
@1471 = ~We'll go that way, then.  Thanks, Nym, and farewell.~
@1472 = ~The hunters do not do much hunting. Not much of anything, in truth. This is not how one must go about his duty.~
@1473 = ~Suoma sent me.  I'm supposed to help you somehow.~
@1474 = ~Tahvo the Huntmaster told of us a "furious ghost" that has been terrorizing their hunting grounds to the west.  Apparently they've slain it at least once, but it simply comes back every day.  There must be some way to get rid of it for good.~
@1475 = ~I had some questions, Tahvo.~
@1476 = ~I wanted to purchase equipment.~
@1477 = ~Greetings, Tahvo, and farewell.~
@1478 = ~This man, Leevi, is too eager to dissuade us. Something's not right here, mark my words. Like Hells we're leaving the ghosts alone!~
@1479 = ~A vile deed it was. Rest easy, spirit, the betrayal will be revealed to your compatriots to deal with as they chose.~
@1480 = ~Farewell, Kyosti.~
@1481 = ~You didn't have to blackmail us, woman. We'd help however we may, regardless. Thing is, delaying us now might just see this whole cursed region blasted into oblivion.~
@1482 = ~The delay might prove insignificant, Nord. We've already saved the children.~
@1483 = ~After defeating Limha and recovering the missing village children for Venla, Suoma the Elder has asked another favor of us: she wants us to speak with and aid Tahvo the Huntmaster.~
@1484 = ~Slow down, Sir. I had other questions for the lady.~
@1485 = ~'Tis no ordinary village. Two winged demons show up, turn half of folk into zombies, all on the account of us dallyin' about... she, a druid, has to do a bit of necromancy - and she *thanks* us! The lady's mad. 'Tis the forest, I bet, as drove them insane. Then again, you have to be mad to make neighbors with the undead in the first place.~
@1486 = ~Oh look, she has a giant along. It's just gettin' better by the minute.~
@1487 = ~Everythin' is deceptive here... I thought 'twas a peaceful hin, and here we are. There's a drow on the village green sellin' his wares like 'tis the most normal thing- ~
@1488 = ~Wait! Selling his wares?! We better take a look, lest we miss the opportunity of a lifetime!~
@1489 = ~Would it be that happiness and love could triumph more often at such a low cost.~
@1490 = ~The cost was life.~
@1491 = ~It always is.~
@1492 = ~Who can know a woman's heart?~
@1493 = ~Thank you, Jaemal, for this revelation. Now what?~
@1494 = ~So... now what?~
@1495 = ~The boy has got both spirit to join the fight and wisdom to run away when there is no hope of winning.~
@1496 = ~This half-elven girl.... There is an air about her that puzzles me. Perhaps, I should speak with her.~
@1497 = ~What stops you? Certainly not me.~
@1498 = ~Indeed, for we might discover something useful or interesting.~
@1499 = ~Oh, my! Am I witnessing the beginnings of grand romance?~
@1500 = ~I thought that you and I... Oh, never mind, go ahead, chat with this flirt.~
@1501 = ~Yes, for as long as you're taking me for a womanizer, going after every skirt.~
@1502 = ~I never presume, Northern Light. Never.~
@1503 = ~<CHARNAME>, that which is between you and I remains between you and I. I don't waver.~
@1504 = ~I wanted to ask the girl about mundane magic.~
@1505 = ~Ahem, of course, of course. Go talk to her. No harm can come out of it and we might discover something useful or interesting.~
@1506 = ~Don't... don't presume!~
@1507 = ~Are you taking me for a fool?~
@1508 = ~No, you aren't.~
@1509 = ~You're right, there could be no harm in talking... discreetly.~
@1510 = ~Pairi, I don't mean to scare you but I believe that you might have sorcery in your blood.~
@1511 = ~Oh, I know of magic coursing through my blood.  It tells me the same of you, though you're much more powerful.  No one here can teach me, but I don't wish to leave the village just yet.  Can you help me?~
@1512 = ~I'm not learned enough to teach you just yet. And I won't be able to stay long either...  Just remember that sorcery can be a dangerous thing, Pairi.~
@1513 = ~Oh, I see.  All right.~
@1514 = ~I can offer you but a few suggestions in the short time that we have.~
@1515 = ~Still, I'd be grateful...~
@1516 = ~To start with I would warn you that sorcery can be a dangerous thing - ~
@1517 = ~We met a young half-elven sorceress-to-be named Pairi en route to the Ice Lakes, and Jaemal helped her to better understand her budding abilities.~
@1518 = ~Puff! And gone. I wish we did be freeing them earlier. My skin was crawling every time they jumped us in the dark wood.~
@1519 = ~What, with your noble bravery?~
@1520 = ~Even the brave ones be afraid sometimes.~
@1521 = ~Why malign yourself, my dear? I'm sure it was lice.~
@1522 = ~You be turning children into minks? They all do be little, but minks be beasts without reason. It be EVIL!~
@1523 = ~He be the smartest of your lot to flee; we indeed be the ones who crashed the goblins and ice-priestesses.~
@1524 = ~Such state as you outlined is a form of travesty and an impossibility, as the races are not equal. However, I shall observe your attempt to annex the territory, if it proves educational.~
@1525 = ~A passage through Underdark is ripe with research opportunities.~
@1526 = ~Yes, I'd always heard there was an entrance to the Underdark at the Black Raven River's headwaters.~
@1527 = ~Go on, Nym...~
@1528 = ~'Tis ripe with drow, and Tymora knows what other dreadful monsters to boot!~
@1529 = ~Shush, Nikosh. Go on, Nym...~
@1530 = ~Damn you, drow. Are you luring us into a trap? I'd rather cut my way through cursed Chimeras then travel in the Underdark.~
@1531 = ~Careful here. Remember what they say: "Not everyone who snores is asleep"!~
@1532 = ~I thought the point was to kill this Oria-priestess here, not to ghostify her!~
@1533 = ~What a thrill! (coughs) ~
@1534 = ~This here is a gaming room fit for a true warrior. It offers a superb battle training.~
@1535 = ~I wish that you've come up with that kind of invention earlier. Would have saved a lot of troubles, damn it! Better later than never though. We'll help you.~
@1536 = ~No! This be WRONG! We be not the ones who trapped you!~
@1537 = ~Oh, beat it. They've gone berserk and wouldn't hear a word if you were singing peace hymns accompanying yourself on a harpsichord.~
@1538 = ~We shouldn't have broken the mirror! Now we'll have seven years of bad luck, startin' with bein' slaughtered by these madmen!~
@1539 = ~I doubt that they're confused at all. More likely they're hoping to rob us of loot or glory.~
@1540 = ~Oh my, a real sentient artifact! I hear they're always a trouble, but 'tis magnificent. Look how carvin' comes almost alive when it speaks. Uhm, should we bring him water or somethin'?~
@1541 = ~Aeij-Kllenzr't, I invoke your true name, Caged Fury, and hereby banish you from this plane of existence!~
@1542 = ~We found one of Auril's altars in a secluded room on the bottom floor of the ice temple.  The altar contained the spirit of a tempest named Aeij-Kllenzr't who was pretending to be Auril, and we banished him from it by invoking his true name, Caged Fury.  He's been keeping the ice from melting, but he couldn't survive outside of the altar in his current form.~
@1543 = ~Your thirst?~
@1544 = ~No. Farewell.~
@1545 = ~Hmm... (leafs through the journal) It seems that they were Luskaners just like you, <CHARNAME>. ~
@1546 = ~Lysara writes here: "Luskan was a gruff town - unforgiving, even if viewed in its best light."~
@1547 = ~Is Luskan indeed as rough a place as that?~
@1548 = ~I... I suppose I was very sheltered, because I didn't notice that.~
@1549 = ~It has a rough edge to it, yes, but unlike the triplets I rather enjoyed it.~
@1550 = ~Oh yes, it's being run by pirates and all.~
@1551 = ~Compared to this region Luskan is the cradle of civilization!~
@1552 = ~Lysara writes here: "Luskan was a gruff town - unforgiving, even if viewed in its best light.  'Tis certainly no place for three innocent, little women..." ~
@1553 = ~Luskan is *horrible*! I feel much safer here, especially when I'm surrounded by strong, powerful companions like you.~
@1554 = ~You can always rely on me to protect you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1555 = ~As almost any town would be. Not many places are as deserted and as wild as the Dale.~
@1556 = ~It sounds like a place where a man like I can find employ without attracting notice. Perhaps I can travel to Luskan with you after our quest here is done.~
@1557 = ~You would, with that daredevil aura about you.~
@1558 = ~You need not sound guilty. The more people there are who needn't struggle to survive every hour, the better.~
@1559 = ~Ooo, ice trolls, Jaemal! Quick, throw a fireball!~
@1560 = ~Wow, this place crawls with ice trolls! A fireball is what's Peony ordered!~
@1561 = ~She be beautiful, even if she be an evil priestess. So white, so pure.... How could that be? (sigh)~
@1562 = ~Why, don't you look pretty: a wench with giant axes. It's too bad that it takes a dwarf to appreciate your style.~
@1563 = ~Imagine, I have 'competition'! (...and I am in a *very generous* mood today to hint that this buffoon can compete with me. Feh, I hope he appreciates it in his senility.)~
@1564 = ~Do you know how I can get to someone connected to this plane of existence, but not affected by it?~
@1565 = ~Ever hear of someone named Aeij-Kllenzr't?~ ~Ondabo~
@1566 = ~Tell me about Caged Fury.~
@1567 = ~Are you a member of this congregation?~
@1568 = ~I'll be leaving now.  Farewell.~
@1569 = ~It's a wicked faith that would turn a kind woman into a cruel vixen. I don't understand devoting one's own self to a deity with such demands.~
@1570 = ~Who's Lysan?~
@1571 = ~Can I ask something else?~
@1572 = ~The cursed Legion promised Auril what's not theirs to give, and Helm willing never will be.~
@1573 = ~Go on, Lysara.~
@1574 = ~I told just that to my companions at the first sight of the temple. But it's not simply the temple, is it? It's *everything*. That's why it sings so...~
@1575 = ~Go on.~
@1576 = ~We learned that three high priestesses of Auril lead a congregation to create the glacier during one of their festivals.~
@1577 = ~Due to Aurelites' foul designs, nature's embrace is becoming a chokehold. Such autrocity cannot be tolerated.~
@1578 = ~There is an antimagic field around your prison? I don't feel it... yet I'm not sensitive to divine forces.~
@1579 = ~We met Nathaniel, a druid from Kuldahar, who'd been locked in one of the ice temple's prison cells.  He asked us to free him before he suffered the same fate as his fellow prisoners, whatever that may be.~
@1580 = ~You say the ice reformed itself?~
@1581 = ~Have you any idea how this glacier can be destroyed?~
@1582 = ~Where are your items again?~
@1583 = ~Where are your items?~
@1584 = ~Have you any idea where they might have taken our equipment?~
@1585 = ~Treasury? Of course there must be a treasury. Here's an idea to cheer my heart.~
@1586 = ~Your guess was correct.  Your equipment was stored in the temple's treasury.~
@1587 = ~It appears the Aurilites went through great lengths to keep invaders away from their treasury on the second level of the temple, but we found Nathaniel's equipment and returned it to him.~
@1588 = ~We found this bag in the temple's treasury.  I believe it's yours.~
@1589 = ~We'll find your equipment.  Farewell for now.~
@1590 = ~We agreed to find the equipment that was taken from Nathaniel by the Aurilites who captured him.  He said that it'd most likely be stored in one of the temple's treasuries.~
@1591 = ~Oh, no! Oh, Tymora, these were all of them out there frozen in ice. And we're not much better off, stuck in this glacier with no hope of rescue!~
@1592 = ~They're gone?~
@1593 = ~For someone who claims to champion half-breeds, aren't you too eager to be rid of your humanity? ~
@1594 = ~I do not discuss my decisions with my lesser.~
@1595 = ~You killed Goublika.  Are the fomorian giants working for you now?~
@1596 = ~Did I mention that was Goublika you killed?~
@1597 = ~What was your name again?~
@1598 = ~We met Sherincal, a towering, female half-blue-dragon guarding the entrance to the Aurilite ice temple.  She claimed to lead the forces of something called the "Legion of the Chimera" in Icewind Dale's western region.  It appears the strange banners we've been seeing belong to them.~
@1599 = ~What are you again?~
@1600 = ~Why are you here?~
@1601 = ~I forgot the reason why you are here.~
@1602 = ~Do you command these Aurilites?~
@1603 = ~Did you say you were the commander of these Aurilites?~
@1604 = ~Enough talk.  Let's end this now!~
@1605 = ~Don't look at me; I have nothing in common with these embittered outcasts seeking to build some ridiculous kingdom in the icy wasteland! Preposterous.~
@1606 = ~Who commands this legion?~
@1607 = ~We also learned from Sherincal that Isair and Madae are twins who rule the Legion of the Chimera from its capitol, the Severed Hand.~
@1608 = ~Tell me again about Isair and Madae.~
@1609 = ~I met fomorian giants in the foothills being abused by a verbeeg giant named Goublika.  Isn't it better to rescue our "siblings" from tyranny rather than wage war against it?~
@1610 = ~The Order be teaching that vengeance be wrong. I do be thinking that asking for peace rather than making war be a better way to start a nation.~
@1611 = ~I was made a slave, humiliated, mutilated, hurt... but it was not because of my heritage. There were purebloods treated the same as me, and it was the purebloods with whom I made a break for freedom. I sympathize with anyone who is oppressed... but here and now, it's the Legion that unleashed a cruel war.~
@1612 = ~If that is your true opinion, aasimar, you *remained* a slave.~
@1613 = ~Aye, you be right, Jaemal.~
@1614 = ~I am relieved to hear that the Legion is a purely political entity. However, I am simultaneously appalled by the half-breeds' temerity in claiming the rights of a nation!~
@1615 = ~What's the Legion of the Chimera?~
@1616 = ~Speaking with Sherincal further we discovered that this Legion of the Chimera is an organization comprised of the disenfranchised freaks of Faerûn.~
@1617 = ~What was the Legion of the Chimera?~
@1618 = ~I will surrender but not because I'm overwhelmed, but because your cause is noble.~
@1619 = ~Surrendered to your noble foe, Sherincal.~
@1620 = ~Sherincal offered us to surrender. That we did. It appears that we're to be imprisoned in the Temple itself, awaiting the execution for our crimes against Chimera nation. Well, once we're inside we can decide if we want to keep our word or destroy the Aurelites. ~
@1621 = ~I be delighted to meet a chivalrious foe who loses not his dignity when we be many against one. Be it not our duty to select a champion to meet him one on one?~
@1622 = ~A strange company, where even such as you speaks fair. But to answer you, orc, I am pleased with the odds. It was always my wish to fall in an epic battle if I can not be victorious. On guard!~
@1623 = ~Oh, look, look! A spider in a harness! It's so cute! Can we keep it? Please? I mean... I mean it can be useful, as a pack-spider for instance.~
@1624 = ~This gives me shivers, and I am not a fretful man.~
@1625 = ~Oh, don't be afraid, it's not going bite you! It's adorable, not at all like other *evil* spiders!~
@1626 = ~Dark... Zack... stuck.... Well, at least he can still rhyme, despite his circumstances.~
@1627 = ~Are you envious, songstress?~
@1628 = ~Feh, rhymes are not yet poetry. This primitive scribbling has all the charm of a grammar book.~
@1629 = ~Oh, dear. I hope that wasn't the entire Neverwinter contingent!~
@1630 = ~I'm glad that we freed these brave men from their icy grave. We should bury them properly after we've routed the heathen.~
@1631 = ~In Malatra one is always wary of killing heat. I shall now have nightmares of dying of cold.~
@1632 = ~Oh, look! This one is a woman.... I wonder if her lovers ever complained if she was frigid.~
@1633 = ~Let us leave this torture scene frozen in time. I think this amulet will open the doors for us. ~
@1634 = ~I think I knew this man... At least his is a familiar face. May Lathander welcome him at the dawn of new life.~
@1635 = ~It's so rude to expect rescue from complete strangers! You know, in Zakhara people have to be formally introduced first.~
@1636 = ~If the behavioral patterns of southern Boring Beetles are identical to those of their northern counterparts - which I presume is a true statement- then the colony must have a nest in the vicinity. ~
@1637 = ~Yeah, it looks like they all are coming from the same direction.~
@1638 = ~Diriel, someone's crying for help, and you want to talk about insects?!~
@1639 = ~Are the southern critters just as disgusting as the northern ones?~
@1640 = ~That's an aptly named animal: a *boring* beetle.~
@1641 = ~Their sentries identified us as a threat and will not relent until the nest is destroyed or we moved out of their foraging area. It is unlikely that we will be leaving the area before the attacks will hinder our progress.~
@1642 = ~If we shall not destroy the nest -if, I repeat, the behavioral patterns are similar, which as I mentioned before is highly probable- I suggest that you resign yourself to the indisputably monotone attacks. Their sentries identified us as a threat and will not relent until the nest is destroyed or we moved out of their foraging area.~
@1643 = ~I resent the adverb you used to describe the creature, but I will not deny that I believe that the two species are closely related, and hence will exhibit remarkable likelihood.~
@1644 = ~It is precisely why I suggest that we seek out the nest, and stop the infestation.~
@1645 = ~We can do it. AFTER we attend to the man crying for our help.~
@1646 = ~Then we shall do so.~
@1647 = ~Why should we destroy their nest? ~
@1648 = ~In this case -if, I repeat, the behavioral patterns are similar, which as I mentioned before is highly probable- you will be attending to the victim while fending off the beetles. Their sentries identified us as a threat and will not relent until the nest is destroyed or we moved out of their foraging area.~
@1649 = ~Logic dictates that by following this direction, we will eventually come upon the nest, and will be able to stop the infestation.~
@1650 = ~Why should we destroy their nest?~
@1651 = ~Hmm, I know many things. What's of interest to you?~
@1652 = ~I'm a hunter of DRAGONS! Do you know anything about a dragon woman in these parts?  Well, DO you?!~
@1653 = ~I saw a dragon woman.  I think she's heading south.~
@1654 = ~We're not sure what will come from it, if anything, but instead of paying Goublika we told him about a dragon woman to stop his fomorian giants from attacking.  He seems to have honored our deal.~
@1655 = ~There's a dragon woman leading a flock of wyverns.  They're headed towards a glacier.~
@1656 = ~All right - here's the gold. If I learn anything about the woman, I'll get back to you.~
@1657 = ~All right, I'll return with the gold or with the information on the dragon woman. Farewell.~
@1658 = ~Stop them and we'll spare your life!  That's what I have to say.~
@1659 = ~Giants did destroy his body, but not his spirit. He did die bravely, not turning away from his foes.~
@1660 = ~And in a great deal of pain. (shudders) Tymora save us from a heroic death if that's what it was.~
@1661 = ~Can't wish for a better epitaph myself. But what a cursed waste of men when the region needs every hand that can wield a sword. Oh, well, we took up the clean-up job and we'll do it.~

@1663 = ~Lycanthropy is a refuge of weak souls who're too afraid to better themselves. They either seek cover in their bestial past life or try to influence what the next one will be. They deserve... pity.~
@1664 = ~Very loquaciously put, er... Miss. I can only add that courtesy produces the sweetest fruits when it's a mutual commodity.~
@1665 = ~So, these men are part... beasts? I knew ladies at court who'd say that about all men. But coming from a talking panther it can be wishful thinking for all we know.~
@1666 = ~A talking panther informed us of the presence of a cult in the foothills.  She said that they were led by a man named Beodaewn, and implied that they were half-man, half-beast.~
@1667 = ~And here stand we, two wise druids, in the primeval forest, carrying on with this minute sparring. Hypothetically, we are able to continue this exchange for a lifetime - a brief moment for the Great Mother. However, it is in our interest to return to our daily labors, such as they are. Can we not come to an arrangement, Panther?~
@1668 = ~May we speak to Illium?~
@1669 = ~Take us to Illium immediately, or I swear we will level your *precious* Andora.~
@1670 = ~What's Andora?~
@1671 = ~We only wish to pass through peacefully.~
@1672 = ~I've nothing more to say to you.  Farewell.~
@1673 = ~Uhm, Diriel?~
@1674 = ~Can you take us there?~
@1675 = ~If we stay away from Andora, will you let us find the things we need to fix our airship?~
@1676 = ~If we go around Andora, will you let us through to the Western Pass?~
@1677 = ~Aurilians?  Who, or what, is Auril?~
@1678 = ~Auril?  The goddess of cold?  You are speaking to a Stormlord of Talos.  My god is the *master* of Auril, and you should show appropriate respect.~
@1679 = ~Is that so?  Well, <CHARNAME> of Bane demands that you step aside before I snap your neck.  Your goddess is pathetic.~
@1680 = ~Auril?  If you are serving her out of fear, let me help you.  The light of Lathander can warm your village and banish Auril's breath back whence it came.~
@1681 = ~We'll turn back.  Farewell.~
@1682 = ~Isn't there any way we could go to your village and work this out?~
@1683 = ~Tell me about Illium again.~
@1684 = ~I'd like to speak to Illium.~
@1685 = ~Andora?  What is Andora?~
@1686 = ~Tell me about Andora again.~
@1687 = ~Why can we not pass through, again?~
@1688 = ~I take orders from no one!~
@1689 = ~We will turn back.~
@1690 = ~More or less.~
@1691 = ~If words fail, I'll find some of your Aurilian companions and char them to cinders.  I'll make sure the bolt of *divine lightning* is bright enough for all to see, even from Andora.~
@1692 = ~Oh, I *will* destroy you if you don't comply.  But, complicity may be in your best interest.  If you serve Auril out of fear, I can take the bite out of her wind.~
@1693 = ~No, not really, I just... wanted to make it clear who I am.~
@1694 = ~And you should not! I understand your plight and your desire to protect your compatriots. But don't you do them disservice by treating with Auril's priests?~
@1695 = ~I have more questions.~
@1696 = ~You're not going to get a chance to honor it, Illium.  In fact, you won't even get a chance to be punished for dishonoring it.  We *massacred* the goblin army at Shaengarne.  Do you think your feeble band of tundra scavengers is going to stop us?~
@1697 = ~Auril's wishes are *irrelevant.*  I am a Stormlord of Talos.  If Aurilian priests have told you to bar our passage, I am telling you to *ignore* that command.  Auril bows to Talos, and so her worshippers will bow to *me.*~
@1698 = ~If you do not let us pass immediately, I will call down hail and lightning on this village in Talos' name.  Those not charred into unrecognizable lumps of flesh will be crushed by hailstones the size of your head.  Do you understand?~
@1699 = ~Auril's power is *nothing* compared to the might of Bane!  You fear her because she might freeze your worthless plants?  If you don't let us pass *immediately,* I will slay you and magically dominate your panther friend.  I'll make the rest of your village watch while she devours your flesh.~
@1700 = ~After every cold winter night comes a warm dawn.  Instead of cowering before a cruel tyrant you fear, why not turn towards the light of Lathander?  Let me deal with the Aurilians, and you will not suffer.~
@1701 = ~Brother, have you lost your way?  You worship Auril, yet her evil nature defies the very core of our beliefs.~
@1702 = ~Why do you worship Auril?~
@1703 = ~Uhm, Diriel, can you-~
@1704 = ~Brother, the lives of Targos' fishermen that I've sworn to protect depend on me passing through your village. It seems to me that removing Aurelians will be beneficial for both of us. You'll not need to cower before a cruel tyrant you fear any longer, and I will do what I vowed to do.~
@1705 = ~My friend, I can see that my brethern here put you into a difficult position. But unlike them, I can deal with Aurelians and protect you from their wrath. I promise that you will not suffer.~
@1706 = ~Instead of cowering before a cruel tyrant you fear, why not let me deal with the Aurilians? I promise that you will not suffer.~
@1707 = ~Consider this information: we were sent to remove the Aurelians and we are sufficiently equipped and skilled to exterminate your insignificant village in the process. Alternatively, you can cooperate and we shall come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Completing our mission will consume less time and resources. You will be rid of your heretical masters.~
@1708 = ~Who might you be?~
@1709 = ~Are you the ranger, Braston?~
@1710 = ~You're wrong!  I am here to finish you off!~
@1711 = ~By Helm, piss must have flooded your brain. Stand down, everyone!~
@1712 = ~Now, you. Are you a ranger called Braston?~
@1713 = ~I have an eerie feeling that what has just passed was not real. But then again, what is?~
@1714 = ~Why, that is regretful. I would have very much liked to see at least one geographical region rid of humans.~
@1715 = ~Daydreaming again, sweet brother?~
@1716 = ~Enough talk!~
@1717 = ~I did be thinking just that way only a short while ago. (sigh) I be so deeply shamed.~
@1718 = ~You mean you weren't a tearful mess of muscles, that makes me watch my backpack every time she sighs? Because it's a pain to chase after it as it flies away with your mighty exhalations?~
@1719 = ~I did not be noticing any such thing when I sigh.~
@1720 = ~That's because I have a good grip on the loot. You should be thankful we haven't lost any yet!~
@1721 = ~Well, thank you, but I do be still doubting -~
@1722 = ~Oh, please do shut up.~
@1723 = ~So, do we have a deal, eh? My heirloom for the whelp's message?~
@1724 = ~Ah, how moving to see such sibling apathy...  So, what is it going to take to get you to give me Yquog's message?~
@1725 = ~You don't deserve to live.  Die, you heartless scum!~
@1726 = ~No deal then.~
@1727 = ~Oh, it doesn't shape up good, does it? Talk carefully, for Tymora's sake! I don't fancy to be served "au armor" with a pinch of dungeon dust for exotic flavoring!~
@1728 = ~Seeing how we're in a dungeon, the dust wouldn't be too exotic. Now, if we were to be baked in Chultian river mud....~
@1729 = ~I don't think this creature is civilized enough to appreciate the fine art of bakin'....~
@1730 = ~Now, that's a fabulous idea! As I said, I'm hungry-~
@1731 = ~Nikosh, for the sake of your sad eyes only.... Whelp, under normal circumstances, *I* would vanquish anyone as foul as you. But I take it these are not normal circumstances.~
@1732 = ~So I take it these are not your normal circumstances?~
@1733 = ~I don't have time for this.  Prepare to die!~
@1734 = ~I think... I think that I, er... I'm not goin' to be able to eat for days now.~
@1735 = ~That would be an occurrence so contrary to nature that it might be considered a minor perversion.~
@1736 = ~You do be looking sick, poor little man, but I do not be understanding why? It must be the airs here.~
@1737 = ~Tee-hee! Then there's a fighting chance for some food to be left for the rest of us come dinner-time!~
@1738 = ~Happy, happy Pondmuk!~
@1739 = ~We brought the goblin, Pondmuk, food as he asked.  He, in return, offered up the password used to gain access to the door near the entrance to the goblin warrens.  The password he gave us was "Chimera."~
@1740 = ~<CHARNAME>, I hope you don't expect *me* to carry these... things?! Brr! Look! It's still *twitching*! *And* oozing something disturbingly green!~
@1741 = ~Handmaidens of Lloth would have fed us to the driders if they knew of this bargain. If we were lucky.~
@1742 = ~So much fuss because of some stupid spiders!~
@1743 = ~Lloth is called the Spider Queen for a reason.~
@1744 = ~Then she should lighten up! Tons of spiders die every day in horrid accidents, like venturing into a goodwife's broom path. Surely, they can't feed the lot of them to the driders!~
@1745 = ~They would be happy to oblige.~
@1746 = ~Oh? Well, I'm not the one who'd be doing the spider-eating. Lloth can have the little goblin!~
@1747 = ~Now that's proper drow thinking.~
@1748 = ~I hope you're taking notes, <CHARNAME>. Bashing heads is important, but it must be the beginner's cursed luck that we stumbled on the villains doing planning. You shouldn't let luck like that go to the chamber pot!~
@1749 = ~Yeah, yeah, I got it. Sherincal is the intermediate boss, Isair and Madae are her superiors. The goblins are to attack Ten Towns again with what army they have here. ~
@1750 = ~Uhm, I got some of it. Guthma is to attack and there was mentioning of big bosses, I think.~
@1751 = ~Notes? Writing too hard, killing is better fun!~
@1752 = ~Will you stop babysitting me already, Nord?!~
@1753 = ~Sir Nord, I would be grateful if you would allow me to do what you have entrusted me with - lead this party. ~
@1754 = ~With a honeyed tongue like that, your cursed head can't be all empty.  I'll bugger off for now, but see to it that I don't regret it.~
@1755 = ~I'll bugger off for now, but see to it that I don't regret it.~
@1756 = ~Never thought that Roedrik would sire a bloody idiot.~ ~Wash your ears and listen! Sherincal is the intermediate boss, Isair and Madae are her superiors. The goblins are to attack Ten Towns again with what army they have here.  Got it?~
@1757 = ~Damn it, try paying attention next time! Old Nord won't always be around to save your backside.~
@1758 = ~Wash your ears then, and listen. Big bosses names are Isair and Madae. Got it?~
@1759 = ~But damn it, try paying attention next time! Old Nord won't always be around to save your backside.~
@1760 = ~Smartly done! I'll bugger off now. You need no wet nurse.~
@1761 = ~(whistles quietly) We were more successful than we might have realized if our foes have started to quarrel amongst themselves.~
@1762 = ~Can't you just *taste* danger emanating from those who speak softly when others yell? It's a mark of power.~
@1763 = ~You're almost drooling, Salomeya. Do you find this scene that alluring?~
@1764 = ~(sways suggestively) Oh, yes!~
@1765 = ~I didn't reckon you were quite so simple.~
@1766 = ~(rolls her eyes) The feeling is mutual, eunuch.~
@1767 = ~No elf would be ashamed to admit her love. This declaration is almost as preposterous as the self-awarded 'Defender of the Wild' title.~
@1768 = ~Dear brother, if the mere mention of love made me turn into a fountain of mush, I'd be ashamed of it too. By Beshaba, can someone put a plug into this wretch? She's going to drown us all.~
@1769 = ~For once you manage to voice an opinion I can agree with, at least in part.~
@1770 = ~You be heartless! We must save Braston. He be our friend and ally and did be captured trying to help us.~
@1771 = ~Oh, scorn me if you must, but save Braston, I beg you!~
@1772 = ~Ennelia, say no more.  If Braston is alive, he will be freed.~
@1773 = ~The ranger Ennelia has charged us with saving her lover, Braston.  We don't know if he still lives, but she believes he may be a captive in the fortress. ~
@1774 = ~You should face facts, Ennelia.  If your love was taken into that fortress, your love is dead.~
@1775 = ~It's like they say - to save your hide from the dragon, one does not have to be the fastest runner in the adventuring company. Just not the *slowest*.~
@1776 = ~Us and what army, I ask you? It all sounds good about a weakness, but what if there aren't any?~
@1777 = ~I see you've collected yet another shoulder bag. (sigh)~
@1778 = ~But there is a lesson in this: a warrior who is burdened like a mule learns how restricting and unnecessary the material possessions are.~
@1779 = ~A Legion of Chimera, burn it! Trust villains to come up with cursed pretty names to cover up the roguery!~
@1780 = ~The Waterdevian fishmongers are more honest than this lot in their bargainin'!~
@1781 = ~You will pay for this with your life, Xuki!~
@1782 = ~The way I see it, even if you kill me, you've already lost the battle.~
@1783 = ~We parlayed with a mage named Xuki at the caravan bridge.  She spoke of a peaceful solution to the war between the Legion of the Chimera and the Ten-Towns, and then asked that we set up a meeting with Lord Ulbrec to facilitate peace talks.  Unfortunately, it was a ruse.  By delaying our assault on the forces at the bridge, it was destroyed.~
@1784 = ~Yes, that's the only remaining course.~
@1785 = ~Oh, is the performance over? I was enjoying myself *tremendously*. You made such a fool of yourself, precious. Of course I've seen through her clumsy lies all along.~
@1786 = ~Why, but them two're the birds of a feather! One for a friend, one for a foe... Tymora help us.~
@1787 = ~What a hopeless dilettante. Couldn't even trick the lot of you!~
@1788 = ~Meanin' she'd done us in better. With friends like that... Tymora help us.~
@1789 = ~To arms then!~
@1790 = ~The unfolding human drama is insignificant in and of itself, but the elimination of any number of Malarites is a worthwhile undertaking.~
@1791 = ~Malarites? Isn't it some obscure cult?~
@1792 = ~I didn't expect you to be so hostile toward the malarites. Isn't Malar connected to nature?~
@1793 = ~Can't say I disagree. Malarites are savage and cruel.~
@1794 = ~What concerns me is that the malarites and their beasts protected the dam built by the orcs, or some such.~
@1795 = ~A wise proposition, though it is demeaning to pay attention to what this despicable lowlife community is doing.~
@1796 = ~Cooperation and coordination between the low forms of life is not unheard of, but as a rule, it does not occur on its own once you pass the bees and ants. We are seeking the masters, the higher creatures, I presume.~
@1797 = ~It is fortunate that you do not give into false mercy on account of these creatures. If you waver, remember that their Hunts believe that the killing must be bloody and prolonged, contrary to nature.~
@1798 = ~I shall remember it. Now, let's charge forward before the Hunt regroups.~
@1799 = ~I am aware of that, Diriel. Now, let's charge forward before the Hunt regroups.~
@1800 = ~Well, let's put the turf wars aside for the moment. What concerns me is that the malarites and their beasts protected the dam built by the orcs, or some such.~
@1801 = ~ Well, let's put the turf wars aside for the moment. What concerns me is that the malarites and their beasts protected the dam built by the orcs, or some such.~
@1802 = ~ The aversion that the priests of Malar profess toward the true defenders of nature is mutual, <CHARNAME>.~
@1803 = ~Can't say I disagree with your disregard for them then. They are a savage and cruel bunch.~
@1804 = ~Malar is a minor deity, also known as a Beastlord. His followers are dedicated to staging bloody hunts, preferably after the humanoid creatures. Alas, these hunts are not restricted to humans, and spread the curse of lycanthropy.~
@1805 = ~Still, I did not expect you to be so hostile toward malarites. They are connected to nature after all.~
@1806 = ~Can't say I disagree with your disregard for them then. They sound like a savage and cruel bunch.~
@1807 = ~That very thought is on my mind as well.~
@1808 = ~Cooperation and coordination between the low forms of life is not unheard of, but as a rule it does not occur on its own, unless you are considering bees and ants.~
@1809 = ~The cursed bees and ants can cooperate in your underpants. This bloody dam is no anthill.~
@1810 = ~I presume that this uncultured outburst means that you are in agreement with my yet unstated thesis that we are seeking the masters, the higher creatures.~
@1811 = ~We are seeking the masters, the higher creatures, I presume.~
@1812 = ~A pity about the cat.~
@1813 = ~Indeed, what purchase we found in slaughtering the mighty animal this way. If it were to be killed, it should have been in a duel of equals, one on one.~
@1814 = ~I must say that an image of you wrestling with the cat has certain appeal. Alas, in this snowy desert, one can hardly hope for you to strip down for the show.... ~
@1815 = ~Yet it was not what I meant.~
@1816 = ~The barbarians that accompany me put so much joyful vigor in slashing and puncturing, that its skin now is good for a colander. A snow leopard colander... (sigh).~
@1817 = ~I let a bout of unjustified benevolence override logic. I deserved this rebuke.~
@1818 = ~Bah, what a stupid thing to get sulky about! Look at me, I've just lost a chance to accentuate the silkiness of my curls with the first-rate fur, and I'm *not* complaining.~
@1819 = ~I reckon there aren't any damn engineers among us? So, we're down to axes, sweat and no fancy calculations....~
@1820 = ~I wouldn't bet for the bridge to stand when the spring melt breaks through, but it'll do the job.~
@1821 = ~Aye, it'll take us across, but I bloody hate doing a shoddy job.~
@1822 = ~And you'd know how to do a proper job, or at the least how to hold a blueprint the right way up?!~
@1823 = ~The Order doesn't always chase cursed kobolds across green groves. Some ill-doers have strongholds and fortresses under their command. I've seen them taken and all the blasted work that went into it.~
@1824 = ~Aha, that would be it, of course.~
@1825 = ~(quickly) What's tangent, Nord?~
@1826 = ~Nothing, we need to fix the damnable bridge.~
@1827 = ~It be good to stretch muscles chopping wood instead of killing.~
@1828 = ~Very fairly noted, Miss. All this blood makes me a tad queasy. Not that I can help much with carpentry, mind.~
@1829 = ~We can't yet say that every *dog* knows us, but we've achieved notoriety among *rats*. Ah, sweet fame!~
@1830 = ~We met GAERNT Sharptooth, a wererat, in Shaengarne Pass.  He claimed to be the ruler of the pass and any who dwelled within.~
@1831 = ~To remove you from the pass.~
@1832 = ~We met a wererat in Shaengarne Pass who may well have been the leader of the forces there.~
@1833 = ~I have no time for this.  Farewell.~
@1834 = ~If this boast is intended to unman us, you shouldn't have bothered. I've read plenty such in histories, and more often than not the brutes choked on words like that.~
@1835 = ~If it is a battle you want, then you shall have it, Gaernat.~
@1836 = ~The winners write histories.~
@1837 = ~The path is narrow, a good place for an ambush. One warrior of skill can hold it against many.~
@1838 = ~That would work both ways, girl. What we need is a couple of our sharp-shooters picking whoever comes out with arrows.~
@1839 = ~Or spells.~
@1840 = ~Or spells. If you've got any left, that's no bloody time to be thrifty with it, that's for sure.~
@1841 = ~Or spells. Tee-hee! I like the look of that rock over there! I can stand on it hurling my mighty magic stuff. Pretty and deadly!~
@1842 = ~If you've got any spells left, that's no time to be thrifty with it, that's for sure. But for Helm's sake, don't stand on the rock, hide behind it. They might have bloody archers too.~
@1843 = ~O-o-okay, but it won't be nearly as impressive!~
@1844 = ~NikoshHarpies~ ~(Under his breath) If we're on killin' them harpies, we've missed un'. ~
@1845 = ~Madness, shorty, often starts with mumbling nonsense under your nose.~
@1846 = ~Y-yes, Mistress Salomeya, mumblin' is a bad habit of mine, I must admit. (Under his breath) And we've been missin' her for days on end....~
@1847 = ~As if the appointed task is not difficult enough now I encounter a troll willing to engage into a human breeding program. As his mental capacity is too limited to comprehend that he will not live long enough to see his scheme succeed, due to the time it takes a human to reach maturity, their relatively slow reproduction rate and the simple necessity to feed them, he must be slain. This 'idea' must not spread among the uneducated masses.~
@1848 = ~Your plan stops here, Vrek.~
@1849 = ~Can't say I like the place any better, but I might be startin' to dislike it less. ~
@1850 = ~Orcs building a fortress and a dam? Either this land is not quite as savage as it appears, or it favors greatly the creatures that resemble her.~
@1851 = ~Hildury, I think you are naïve, thinking that the orcs can be converted.~
@1852 = ~Where there is intellect to build, it turns away from destruction. Or it can be led away.~
@1853 = ~I'm afraid that your companion is too optimistic. The orcs' motives cannot be benevolent.~
@1854 = ~But what is it? Why would the orcs build a dam?~
@1855 = ~Don't look at me, I don't fancy goin' a-heroin' into a pen full of orcs, invisible or not.~
@1856 = ~I think a warrior with quick reflexes, such as I, is better suited for this task, Master Nikosh. I can do it, if our commander decides to send me forth.~
@1857 = ~It is our duty to see a holy warrior reunited with her sacred weapon. I'm not a devotee of Selunè, but such a service is likely to find us favor with the benevolent gods venerated in this part of the world.~
@1858 = ~The stupid cow had her blade stolen from under her nose. If you ask me, she does not deserve anyone fetching it back, least of all us, the fledging heroes of the Icewind Dale. We have to take care of heroic feats and the world saving routine.~
@1859 = ~I have never seen so many dead in one place before, at least none warriors. I wish that I never have to see something similar again.~
@1860 = ~We but did our duty, and I feel jubilant.~
@1861 = ~Very well, I shall try to help your people.~
@1862 = ~Kaitlin asked us to free her people from the orcs.  She said that they are being held captive at a nearby mill.  To free them we would need to unlock the gate to the mill and then slay the orc guards.  Unfortunately, the gate can only be unlocked from within the orc camp.  We would have to sneak in, unlock the gate, and then sneak back out.   We refused and chased her off.~
@1863 = ~I will consider the matter.  Farewell.~
@1864 = ~No.  Now get out of my sight before I slay you as well.~
@1865 = ~If your people mean so much to you, then die with them!~
@1866 = ~What in the Nine Hells you think you're saying? You run, lady, while I pound some decency into the cursed pup.~
@1867 = ~Kaitlin asked us to free her people from the orcs.  She said that they are being held captive at a nearby mill.  To free them we would need to unlock the mill's gate and then slay the orc guards. Unfortunately, the gate can only be unlocked from within the orc camp.  We would have to sneak in, unlock the gate, and then sneak back out.   We refused. I would have killed the foolish woman, but Nord meddled, and she ran off.~
@1868 = ~Don't panic. What Kaitlin suggested isn't as simple as to crash a few orcs' necks, but not too elaborate of a plan either. Just tell whomever you send in to keep his head, and shout if the apothecary's wares lost its potency from the bloody cold.~
@1869 = ~You stay away from me.  I know not for a certainty if it went wrong or it didn't, but I like not a single cursed bit that the innocent blood was spilt here.~
@1870 = ~What did I tell you! You do have your Sire's spirit in you.~
@1871 = ~Victories do not taste this bitter.~
@1872 = ~Our story here is just beginning, but here is one happy ending. ~
@1873 = ~I be broken-hearted that we did fail, but I will not let it break me. We be striking onward from here and do what be good. Or try to. Yes?~
@1874 = ~You be a clever <MANWOMAN>. I did be afraid it be one of the puzzles that have no easy solution.~
@1875 = ~Allow me. (Deliberately drops the Potion of Invisibility.)~
@1876 = ~This slightly clumsy demonstration confirms that gravity works each and every time. It is a powerful force in service of Mother Nature. Shall  we proceed with attacking the orcs now?~
@1877 = ~I must express my satisfaction with the clean and precise way in which you conducted this affair. A simple, elegant solution, worthy of the highest praise.~
@1878 = ~Your misguided mercy will cost hundreds of lives. The native flora and fauna in this area will continue to be eradicated by these parasites.~
@1879 = ~A human druid, this Dereth, is a preposterous notion. So far I have not found a complete and painless way to sever the bond that these primitives have woven. Pull on this thread, and the tapestry is spoiled. But humans being easily corrupted, I have no doubt that the 'civilization' heresy will eventually purge them from our midst.~
@1880 = ~And now we see the goodwife hurry home to her husband so he can finally get a hearty home-cooked meal. Poor dear must have suffered so much without the sickly-sweet love and attentions!~
@1881 = ~Feh!~
@1882 = ~I have seen the trees in your Northern forests. They are not willowy lianas; they are thick and strong enough to stop a sword even when they are not frozen. It appears to me that a good axe will be of more use.~
@1883 = ~When I gave my vow of chastity I was a suckling pup. Now I know that a lone wolf brings no grief to anyone and has but his own stiff neck to offer for an evil-doer's axe.~
@1884 = ~I'm glad we came this way. The orcs are not in a habit of returning women unharmed to their husbands.~
@1885 = ~Has it ever occurred to you that women are not all helpless spring flowers needing manly champions?~
@1886 = ~A couple of times. Still, she is alone against the Clan of the Broken Tusk.~
@1887 = ~At least in that you're a man. Of course, our unfortunate forest nymph needs rescuing! From a man you would expect no less than to slay every orc single-handedly!~
@1888 = ~I don't understand why you're arguing a point that I didn't bring up, and the views I didn't express. Let's just leave it and do what we can.~
@1889 = ~ Wait...  What is this?  You half-orc.  You share blood of our ancestors, sister.  Why you come here with weapon drawn?  Why you ready to spill orc blood? ~
@1890 = ~I be ready to plead with my commander to spare the lives of you and yours if you put down your weapons and open the passage. No blood be spilt then.~
@1891 = ~You mad! But at least you talk. Why you fight for human scum that spurns us? You join with Torak. You join Broken Tusk Clan.  We blood brother and sister!~
@1892 = ~Better I die as a human, than live as an orc. No, not as an orc. As you live. Plundering, raping, burning! I be disgusted by it and I always be fighting against it. With humans and in the name of the Order of the Radiant Heart!~
@1893 = ~A strong woman can do well in the Broken Tusk Clan, but she go mad, don't see honor Torak offered her. Makes Torak mad too. Don't want you leave, want you fight and die on my Clan's blades.~
@1894 = ~And who might you be?~
@1895 = ~Bold words.  Let us see if you can back them up.~
@1896 = ~I am not leaving until I cleanse the river of your filth, orc.~
@1897 = ~ Prepare to die!~
@1898 = ~Wait, <CHARNAME>! There be another way. Don't you be seeing, Chieftan Torak, what gifts the goodness and righteousness put on us?~
@1899 = ~You mad! But at least you talk. Do you want to die with humans, or do you want to join the Broken Tusk Clan?~
@1900 = ~Better I die as a human, than live as an orc. No, not as an orc. As you live. Plundering, raping, burning! I be disgusted by it and I be fighting against it. With humans and in the name of the Order of the Radiant Heart!~
@1901 = ~Then die, half-humans!~
@1902 = ~He did seem to be strong, but I reckon he be more of an... agile sort of a fighter after we did see him turn on his heels and flee so many times.~
@1903 = ~So be it!~
@1904 = ~These orcs, they sure look mighty tall an' so stocky!~
@1905 = ~These here be barrels, not proud warriors of the Broken Tusk Clan!~
@1906 = ~I... I knew that, Sir. Was kiddin', is all. To... to er... lift spirits.~
@1907 = ~Ha! Now Broken Tusk Clan comes! Orcs salt your flesh in these barrels for the winter. Except for the heads. The heads we send to Targos.~
@1908 = ~I... I don't think I like the arrangement, though it's economical and well thought out.~
@1909 = ~Kill dogs now!~
@1910 = ~After defeating this menace of a barrel, goblins should be no threat to our mighty company! But wait, haven't we already gone through goblins like through so many sunflower seeds to split and spit out? Feh. I suggest that we start thinking on a grander scale than slaughtering barrels.~
@1911 = ~And now you get to pass it on.  To me.~
@1912 = ~We collected on our bet from Gable, and I think we have dulled him of any desire to gamble in the near future.~
@1913 = ~Then don't concern yourself with it - we'll consider it a friendly wager, nothing more.  Farewell.~
@1914 = ~Have you even bothered to think about anything but your own overblown sense of self-worth? That longbow would have served adequately as my weapon. Until we found something better, of course. With spoiled brats like you, a poor woman has to always look out for her own interests.~
@1915 = ~You take breaks from that chore? I'm surprised.~
@1916 = ~They *really* should cut tongues in addition to manhoods.~
@1917 = ~No wonder they call him swift. This boy has the speed and reflexes of a warrior. It's a pity that his talent is wasted on being a messenger. In a Monastery, he'd be taught control and discipline, the two qualities that he sorely lacks.~
@1918 = ~Oh, bloody hells! Lord Ulbrec relies on his enemies' stupidity far too much. And I sense malicious intellect behind this cursed mess. Shit, I should have come earlier.~
@1919 = ~Uhm, sir, not to spoil your tirade here and all, but my folk venerate Walkeen no less than yours. With luck, once this has all boiled over we'll benefit from the new trade opportunities.~
@1920 = ~Luckily, Quinn Silverfinger is the only one of your useless kind whose prattle I *must* endure.~
@1921 = ~I mourn your loss.~
@1922 = ~Well, it's better to be tearing down homes than burying bodies. Farewell.~
@1923 = ~So do I. But the desperate bravery in this man's eyes gives me hope that Targos will endure. When this kind of quiet heroism manifests itself, when men destroy their own houses to patch the walls, is when against all odds the battles are won.~
@1924 = ~Cold words, my friend. When this kind of quiet heroism manifests itself, when men destroy their own houses to patch the walls, is when against all odds the battles are won.~
@1925 = ~I did see a drink make men braver, but this one he become just... drunk. He be as good as dead. That be a fitting fate for a coward, but he be pitiful in his shame.~
@1926 = ~These half-sentient beings are afraid of a merchant? I find it both droll and pathetic.~
@1927 = ~Observe how critiquing without proper knowledge of the subject magnifies the impression that the human in question is ignorant and hypocritical.~
@1928 = ~No crime is more revolting than treachery. I must stay neutral while I carry on my duty, but this man's death... I celebrate it!~
@1929 = ~No more weeping? Ah, a pity. They should have kept her here as a cautionary tale for all little girls. In fact, they should have brought them here every night to look at the ghost and see what love does to stupid women.~
@1930 = ~But, I haven't seen any little girls around, so might as well get rid of the noise.~
@1931 = ~I know I might come across as someun' who likes the dead, but I assure you, I only like 'em as far as the creations of their hands goes. I'm not keen on gettin' familiar with assorted corpses. If we were to just back out slowly right now, I wouldn't mind.~
@1932 = ~There are great wonders in the world: magnificent artifacts and breathtaking buildings, manuscripts full of unlocked potential, ancient wards.... And sometimes, you walk upon a gnome who built a flying ship. (Shakes his head).~
@1933 = ~I don't think that I shall ever grow weary of traveling and seeing for myself things of genius, great and small.~
@1934 = ~There is always an incurable sadness about the dead, and those who come close to them. At least I've witnessed it often.~
@1935 = ~He said he be needing a score of men. I did be knowing an ogrillion who boasted he had the strength of a score of strong men, after eating their hearts. I be not as strong, but I be as good as three, I reckon. Or five. Or... I be not knowing. Numbers be worse than letters.~
@1936 = ~I have no desire to stay in this house of ill repute. Let us be away before I am so sickened by this... marriage that I cannot remain civil.~
@1937 = ~I will not tolerate the mockery of my cause.~
@1938 = ~Helm save us from priests on war councils. They should bloody stick to healing.~
@1939 = ~Shall we lend it to them instead, our precious wasted exhalations over a league's distance? It'll do so much good, I'm sure.~
@1940 = ~Still, it's the gesture that counts. Here, have it, my brave soldiers... (blows a kiss).~
@1941 = ~'Tis cozy here, with all the dogs sleepin' around the fire. And the smell from the kitchens is nice. Which reminds me that it's almost mealtime. Why don't we stop for a bite? Questin' on an empty stomach aren't a good idea, this un' thinks.~
@1942 = ~Nikosh, Nikosh, for you there're but two hours in the day: mealtime and almost mealtime.~
@1943 = ~The way things are shaping up, we'll be in a battle soon enough. Only a fool would wade into battle still sluggish from a big meal.~
@1944 = ~What bitter irony it is, that it falls to me to help humans survive.~
@1945 = ~Bitter, bitter irony....~
@1946 = ~I be afraid that these kits are kin to the dead one we be carrying.~
@1947 = ~It's our business because we came to defend this town, and your vision might help. I sense presence... power swirling around you. Please, speak. You will not be shunned.~
@1948 = ~'Tis most healthy attitude they got here, if I may say so. Just help yourselves to the supplies. Why, if only some antique dealers I knew were so generous!~
@1949 = ~Healthy warriors drinking while the town is under siege? They're doing little to elevate their homeland in others' eyes by shirking their duty.~
@1950 = ~Scum like that is born to every land. These thugs cannot dull Cormyr's bright glory.~
@1951 = ~Blah-blah-blah. What is interesting, however, is how bright his eyes were during this uncomplicated spiel. If I did not know better, I could have sworn there was a hint of pride there.~
@1952 = ~We, pups, should leave this moron to wait on the salty dogs in iron collars.~
@1953 = ~Ah, the bustling metropolis of Targos! I feel so insignificant, so provincial. Feh.~
@1954 = ~Salomeya is sleepy!~
@1955 = ~A cursed good work, my brave dwarf! A squad of knights couldn't have done better. And all by yourself, I wager?~
