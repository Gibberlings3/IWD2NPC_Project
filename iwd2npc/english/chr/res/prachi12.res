Prachi was born to a noble family in the Kuong Kingdom jungles in fabled Malatra. A birth like many others, but strange things kept happening when the house astrologer tried to draw the girl's horoscope to determine her Path and Future. Fearing that Prachi is a Star-lost, the astrologer advised the parents to bring the girl to the Temple City of Ratneshwar. The wise priests there would be able to determine the appropriate Path of Duty for the girl. Upon years of study, the sages declared that Prachi should undertake a perilous pilgrimage and she embarked on a long journey starting in the port city of Marabaya. Her road eventually led her to the Spine of the World, a place her teachers say was one of the world's beginnings.
