Valeero, a Priestess of Lathander, arrived from Neverwinter ahead of her regiment to arrange the transport and provisions. With that quickly accomplished, she almost immediately got tired of waving the ships with mercenaries off the pier. Valeero then left an acolyte in charge of waiting in Luskan and bought a passage on the Wicked Wench. Looking into these sharp eyes, and handsome, tanned, almost ageless face, you quickly get the idea that you have acquired an assertive, driven companion. It also does not take long to notice that in addition to her expertise Valeero brings to the table a pocketful of sayings, both tried and true, and the ones she had probably invented on the spot. Something in her manner hints at the past hardships, now overcome; it is also evident that presently Valeero knows joy and fulfillment.
