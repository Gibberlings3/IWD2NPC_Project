Name=Sir Nord’s Company
Descr1=Sir Nord’s Company is a group of adventurers that Sir Nord Wind, a paladin of the Order of the Radiant Heart assembled on the request of his friend, Sir Roederik of Luskan to answer the call of besieged Targos, when the Order was unable to come up with a contingent of knights to send forth quickly enough. Sir Nord and his loyal squire were rumored to swipe through Luskan Docks, recruiting people in great haste, for it was more important to them to come to Targos’ aid, than to wait till the ideal candidates would show up in the Pirate City. Unlike some of his colleagues, Sir Nord places little stock in the outward appearances, and believes in getting job done with the cadre he has.

Descr8=Sir Nord by all appearances is a commoner who made it up in the ranks of the Order. Crude but efficient, rough but fair, the man is liked by an astonishing number of people and hated by just as many.  He is accompanied by his loyal squire, Hildury the Half-Orc that he saved on a battle field and converted. Or, more accurately, she converted herself. In Sir Nord Hildury sees the ideal of goodness and righteousness. Her only goal in life is to serve her knight and pay for the horrible deeds she’d committed in the past. Jaemal is a Mulhorandi sorcerer with a touch of divine blood. Either that, or some inner conflict gives him a troubling, bitter aura. He speaks little of his past, but one could gather that he is an escaped slave. Salomeya Orsini, the bard extraordinaire, on the other hand, is ready to talk for hours on end about her past adventures, romantic and otherwise. She originates from Turmish or Calimshan, depending on the hour of the day and the particular story, but always from the aristocratic circles. Nikosh, the Chessentian antique dealer that had fallen on the hard times was probably hired for his expertise with lock-picking and trap finding rather than his knowledge of the ancient artifacts. Why he is so skilled in those areas is anyone’s guess. The last one to join the company, Diriel, is an elven druid. He is mostly keeping to himself, though it is not inconceivable, that after a while his companions will learn if there are dark secrets lurking behind his cold silence, or he is just haughty. Or both.
